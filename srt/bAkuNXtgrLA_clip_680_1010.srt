292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,050
Moving right along, all
those subcortical bits, we're

293
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,570
just going to talk about three
of the most important ones,

294
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,090
the thalamus, this
big guy right smack

295
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,030
in the middle of the brain,
very large structure,

296
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,430
the hippocampus,
and the amygdala.

297
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,410
OK, let's talk
about the thalamus.

298
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,420
Think about the thalamus
as a Grand Central

299
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,780
Station of the brain, OK,
with all of these connections

300
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,700
going to all those
parts of cortex

301
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,650
coming in and out of
the thalamus like that.

302
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,720
OK?

303
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,200
So one of the key things
about the thalamus

304
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,380
is that most of the
incoming sensory information

305
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,310
goes by way of the thalamus
en route to the cortex.

306
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,850
OK?

307
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,520
So if you start with
your ear, there's

308
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,440
sensory endings in
your ear that we'll

309
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,030
talk about later in the term.

310
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,120
And they send neurons into
this, the thalamus here,

311
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,675
this yellow thing, through
a bunch of different stages.

312
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,050
They make a stop
in the thalamus.

313
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,180
And then they come up
here to this green patch,

314
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,220
which is auditory cortex.

315
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,360
OK?

316
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,260
Similarly,
somatosensory endings,

317
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,300
touch sensors in
your skin that enable

318
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,120
you to feel when
you're being touched

319
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,490
come in through the skin.

320
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,890
And they make a stop
in the thalamus.

321
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,880
And then they go up to
somatosensory cortex up there.

322
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,320
OK?

323
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,030
Similarly, visual signals
that come in from your eyes

324
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,250
make a stop in the thalamus and
then go up to visual cortex.

325
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,010
OK, what's the name of the
structure in the thalamus

326
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,218
that those axons
make a synapse in?

327
00:01:31,218 --> 00:01:33,260
Coming up from the eyes,
you make a synapse here.

328
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,360
And you go up to visual cortex.

329
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,210
AUDIENCE: LGN.

330
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,460
NANCY KANWISHER: LGN, perfect.

331
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,210
What does it stand for?

332
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,480
AUDIENCE: Lateral
geniculate nucleus.

333
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:39,960
NANCY KANWISHER: Perfect.

334
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,190
OK, you should know that.

335
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,670
This is review from 900, 901.

336
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,320
OK, yes?

337
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:47,820
Sorry.

338
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,890
OK, which sensory modality does
not go through the thalamus

339
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,110
en route to cortex
between the sensory nerve

340
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,190
endings and the cortex?

341
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:58,690
Sorry?

342
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,470
AUDIENCE: Olfactory.

343
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,310
NANCY KANWISHER: Yes.

344
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,820
Yes.

345
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,862
You guys are on the ball.

346
00:02:01,862 --> 00:02:04,570
Yes, olfactory system is
the one sensory modality

347
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,830
that doesn't make a
stop in the cortex.

348
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,080
You can sort of see that here.

349
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,980
From the nose, it goes straight
up into olfactory cortex

350
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,020
right there.

351
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,410
All right, so that's
the standard view

352
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,630
of the thalamus is this
kind of like relay station

353
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,420
where all the external sensory
information comes in there,

354
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,550
makes a stop, and then
goes up to cortex.

355
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,450
OK?

356
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,140
That's my thalamus act.

357
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:27,640
Boom.

358
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,360
Like that, right?

359
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,260
OK.

360
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,530
But, increasingly,
there's evidence

361
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,020
that the thalamus is much
more than a relay station.

362
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,120
And why would you bother
with a relay anyway?

363
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,080
Kind of doesn't mean anything.

364
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,100
Kind of means like
we don't know what's

365
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,960
going on here because
you wouldn't just make

366
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,710
a synapse for no reason, right?

367
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,838
OK, and so the
first thing to note,

368
00:02:45,838 --> 00:02:47,380
is there are lots
of connections that

369
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,160
go back down the other way?

370
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,460
There are 10 times
as many connections

371
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,620
that go from primary
visual cortex

372
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,350
right here in me, right
here in this guy in red,

373
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,100
there are 10 times as many
that go backwards down

374
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,420
to the thalamus as go forwards.

375
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,950
That's mind blowing, right?

376
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,320
Information comes from the
eyes up into the brain.

377
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,233
What the hell are those things
doing going backwards, OK?

378
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,400
Well, they're doing all
kinds of interesting things.

379
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,858
So that's the first indication
that the thalamus isn't just

380
00:03:15,858 --> 00:03:19,820
relaying stuff in a
stupid, passive way.

381
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,370
And the second
whole line of work,

382
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,900
which many people
are working on,

383
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,780
but I think some of the most
awesome work on this topic

384
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,170
is done by our own Mike
Halassa in this department.

385
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,030
And he does these
incredible studies

386
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,940
that you can do in mice with
these spectacular methods

387
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,270
that we can't use in humans,
where he can really take apart

388
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,760
the circuit and
magnificent detail.

389
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,350
And he's showing
that the thalamus

390
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,920
is involved in all kinds
of high-level cognitive

391
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,660
computations in mice.

392
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,890
It's really stunning work.

393
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,560
When the mice have to switch
from doing one task to another,

394
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,910
the thalamus plays a key role in
gating the flow of information

395
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,780
from one cortical
region to another, OK?

396
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,390
All right, moving along,
the hippocampus, I you

397
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,560
guys all learned about this.

398
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,300
The number one gripe
in this department

399
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,430
as we learn about
H.M. in every course.

400
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,730
So that's going to happen here.

401
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,460
But it's going to
last about 20 seconds.

402
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,510
So here goes.

403
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,947
That's a normal slice
of the brain like this.

404
00:04:12,947 --> 00:04:14,530
Here's the hippocampus
on either side.

405
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,400
It's like a whole curled up deal
right there and right there.

406
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,820
And here is H.M.'s brain,
the famous H.M., who

407
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,850
had surgery to remove his
hippocampus on both sides,

408
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,690
and completely lost his episodic
memory for anything that

409
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,470
happened after his surgery.

410
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:30,970
OK?

411
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,180
You all remember that, right?

412
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,310
If anybody hasn't heard
of H.M., send me an email.

413
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,320
And I'll give you some
background reading.

414
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,610
OK, so very loosely,
the hippocampus

415
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,650
involved both in this kind
of long-term episodic memory

416
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,940
that H.M. lost.

417
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,790
And it also plays a
key role in navigation,

418
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,970
which we'll talk about in
great detail in a few weeks.

419
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,940
And I just want to say
that some cases are

420
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,700
even more extreme than H.M.

421
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,230
So there's a case of
Lonni Sue Johnson.

422
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,080
And I am trying to
get you guys a video.

423
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,290
And I didn't get it in time.

424
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,915
But I'll show it to you later in
the term if you're interested.

425
00:05:05,915 --> 00:05:08,740
Lonni Sue Johnson
had a viral infection

426
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,340
that went up into her brain.

427
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,820
She was an extremely
accomplished person.

428
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,250
She did illustrations on
the cover of The New Yorker.

429
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,180
She was a pilot.

430
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,640
She had her own
farm in which she

431
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,170
raised lots of stuff, a
very smart, interesting,

432
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,100
multitalented woman, who
had this terrible tragedy

433
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,980
of getting viral
encephalitis at I

434
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,870
don't know what
age, but middle age.
