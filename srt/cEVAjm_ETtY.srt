1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,840
it often has felt like to me as I've

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,160
learned more and more like oh my God

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,759
wait a minute we've just kind of treated

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:09,120
women and our health almost like if

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,000
you're golfing there's the tea That's

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,160
further back for the guys and there's

7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,599
the tea that's a little bit like closer

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,240
for the women and we're just going to

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,920
treat everybody the same but shrink it a

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,080
little bit we'll take running shoes or a

11
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,039
bicycle all they do is they make it a

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,439
little bit smaller maybe put some pink

13
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:26,519
on it and say it's a woman's product we

14
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,800
experience things differently as women

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,880
than men do but that's not ever really

16
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,719
explained when we look at the trends of

17
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,920
the fasted training don't eat be it's

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,960
all on maale data if you look at most

19
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,440
women who make a point to get up do some

20
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,840
training go

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,640
exercise and after four weeks of

22
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,199
following the same kind of training

23
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:49,680
program as their male partner their male

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,879
partner has gotten leaner fitter better

25
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:53,680
focus all of the things that you want at

26
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,559
of fitness and the woman's like how come

27
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,239
I'm fatter and tired we have gotten into

28
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,120
a societal idea that we all live in the

29
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,359
same kind of temperature we have

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,040
automatic garage door openers we have

31
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,520
created this environment where we don't

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,400
move and if we're talking about how do

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,799
we just make one small change to improve

34
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,759

thrilled that you're here in our Boston

107
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,360
studios I've been waiting a long time to

108
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,680
be able to sit down meet you and learn

109
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,280
from you I'm just thrilled that you're

110
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,640
here oh thanks for having me I'm excited

111
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,120
have lots of fun and we have a lot to

112
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,359
dig into and so here's where I want to

113
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:23,840
start could you speak directly to the

114
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,880
person that's

115
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,000
listening and this is somebody who

116
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,759
doesn't have a lot of time but they made

117
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:31,240
the time yep to be here to learn from

118
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,720
you okay what could that person expect

119
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,479
might change about their life or feel

120
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:39,479
different if they take everything to

121
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,120
heart that you're about to teach us and

122
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,080
share with us today and they use it in

123
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,520
their own life I find there's two big

124
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,280
things that often happen one most women

125
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,800
become more empowered and have better

126
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,039
body positivity and two they have a

127
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:58,000
sense of separation from the stress and

128
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,919
their own selves so they're able to take

129
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:02,720
that step back from the stress of

130
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,560
everything that's happening it's kind of

131
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,800
like that pause moment because when you

132
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,039
are taking care of your body then it

133
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,479
feeds back into a lot of positive

134
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,360
metrics so the big thing that I love is

135
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,600
watching women go through an evolution

136
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,919
to go from being not so confident in

137
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:23,280
themselves to having such empowerment to

138
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,000
be able to stand up and say I own this

139
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,600
space and I'm taking it you know one

140
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,199
thing that strikes me about your

141
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,120
already is that

142
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,840
you

143
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,520
actually exude that oh thanks now you

144
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,880
have a level of presence and power in

145
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,440
your body and it's not just because you

146
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,840
are in incredibly great shape in terms

147
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,840
of muscle definition

148
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,560
but it's it's actually something that's

149
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,120
noticeable and so I think this goes

150
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,800
beyond sort of that sense of separation

151
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,960
of stress like what I experience in just

152
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,680
sitting here with you is that you're

153
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,639
actually embodied in the present and in

154
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,720
your body and a lot of times when we're

155
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,360
stressed out especially you know as

156
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,280
caregivers and the amount of stuff that

157
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,680
we do we're up in our heads and

158
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,080
disconnected from our body yeah and so

159
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,599
I'm excited to really learn from you

160
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:24,000
because I want to feel more like the

161
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,759
centered confidence and calmness that

162
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,919
you just seem to move through a space

163
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,400
with I'm good with the facade no just

164
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,840
kidding thanks um yeah it does come from

165
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,199
a lot of pushback I've had in my life so

166
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,199
it's like putting being put into a

167
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,039
pretty Mal dominant situation you have

168
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,120
to find your feet and how do you move

169
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,720
through that space and I found it

170
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,919
through exercise strength all the stuff

171
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,440
that we're going to talk about amazing

172
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,639
so you have such an incredible

173
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,639
background and I'm actually going to

174
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,199
read it because it's quite a bit you

175
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,919

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,560
that participates in her own studies and

186
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,160
you have this incredible Mantra Dr

187
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,800
Sims women are not small men yeah what

188
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,199
does that mean yeah um I laugh when

189
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,759
people say women are not small men

190
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,720
because when we hear it we're like oh

191
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,280
yeah that's right but it's started from

192
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,039
when I was teaching at Stanford and

193
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:50,080
wanted to wake some of the undergrads up

194
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,960
after and lunch and afternoon sleepies

195
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,080
come in and I was teaching about sex

196
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,960
differences in training or high

197
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,000
performance so I would started with

198
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,680
women are not small men and people are

199
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,520
like well of course not like that's you

200
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,680
know women aren't small men but what I

201
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,919
mean by that is everything from what

202
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:11,639
happens in utero until we die is

203
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,479
different for women than men so when we

204
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,000
talk about women are not small men and

205
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,159
we see all the guidelines that are out

206
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:20,080
there for exercise all the guidelines

207
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,639
out there for mental health for the

208
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,520
connections the sociocultural pressures

209
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,440
we experience things differently as

210
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,960
women than men do but that's not ever

211
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,479
really explained so when we say women

212
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,159
are not small men it makes people take

213
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,159
that pause and ask well what do you mean

214
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,080
by that what topic so today what I mean

215
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,000
by women are not small men is we're

216
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,240
going to dive into exercise especially

217
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,040
how what we do should change as we move

218
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,279
through our lives what does that motto

219
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,040
women are not small men mean in

220
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,920
practice I think when we look right now

221
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,959
at what's being portrayed in social

222
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:03,480
media fitness Trends the medical Trends

223
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,120
all of that data is really drawn from

224
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,440
men and just generalized to women which

225
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,519
is a huge disservice so I want women

226
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,959
especially you as a listener on this

227
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:16,200
podcast to take a pause whenever you see

228
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,399
a new trend come up or someone pushing

229
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,920
something to just go well where do this

230
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,519
originate how does that appropriate for

231
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,200
me as a woman in my phase of life and

232
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,880
when you take that pause you begin to

233
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,000
have an objection to some of the things

234
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,200
that are being pushed on you and and an

235
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,800
objective view of how you should

236
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,600
approach things to make it beneficial

237
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,279
for you I am so glad that we're starting

238
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,279
here because

239
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:46,720
um I am constantly shocked at the things

240
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,000
that I think I should be

241
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,200
doing and the things that I hear a lot

242
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,640
of male Health experts talking about or

243
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,959
a lot of the Bro Science or a lot of the

244
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,000
kind of bro experts and the Fitness

245
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,160
trends that are very dude oriented no

246
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,000
offense to the guys I'm just saying that

247
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,600
it often has felt like to me as I've

248
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,920
learned more and more like oh my God

249
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,519
wait a minute we've just kind of treated

250
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,880
women and our health almost like if

251
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,760
you're golfing there's the tea That's

252
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,880
further back for the guys and there's

253
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,320
the tea that's a little bit like closer

254
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,959
for the women and we're just going to

255
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,640
treat everybody the same but shrink it a

256
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,200
little bit yep shrink and pink is what

257
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,800
we called it in the industry shrink and

258
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,399
pink shrink and pink so uh we'll take

259
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:32,160
running shoes or a bicycle all they do

260
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,399
is they make it a little bit smaller

261
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,800
maybe put some pink on it and say it's a

262
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,120
woman's product it's so true I know and

263
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,959
it's like wait that's not really

264
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,600
appropriate you'll see in my book

265
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,200
there's some pink and that's an oage to

266
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,680
shrink in pink because that's what

267
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,399
people think is honoring women by making

268
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,320
it a little bit smaller let's bling it

269
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,160
up with some color and we're going to

270
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,440
call it a woman's product and that is

271
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,959
not appropriate well the other thing

272
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,399
that I think has been like really

273
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,240
fascinating we're going to get into this

274
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,399
is just that a lot of the research has

275
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:08,079
only been done on men and there hasn't

276
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,200
been research on how certain things have

277
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,360
an impact on women and our hormones and

278
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,519
our body structure and our composition

279
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,480
which is as you've already said

280
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,240
fundamentally different than that of

281
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,680
somebody who's male yeah and so I'm

282
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,720
excited for you to take a step by step

283
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,800
by step and help us kind of tee up all

284
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,600
the assump iions that we've all just

285
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,760
kind of come to assume that work for men

286
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,399
but don't work for women and what we

287
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,760
need to know and need to be doing to

288
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,680
actually work with our bodies and take

289
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,880
better care of ourselves perfect so

290
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,639
what's the most common mistake that

291
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:49,279
women make by following male Centric

292
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,399
Fitness

293
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,320
advice uh they don't get any results and

294
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,760
they end up what we call tired but wired

295
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,000
I mean if you look at most women who

296
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,120
make a point to get up do some training

297
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,959
go

298
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:05,200
exercise and it happens so often after

299
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
four weeks of following the same kind of

300
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,639
training program as their male partner

301
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:11,200
their male partner has gotten leaner

302
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,440
fitter better um cognition you know

303
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,079
Focus all of the things that you want

304
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,920
out of fitness and the woman's like how

305
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,199
come I'm fatter and tired and I don't

306
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:22,680
have any like increase in my fitness

307
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,199
like my partner does and I see it all

308
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:28,000
the time and I'm always explaining well

309
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,839
one your partner might get up and go

310
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,560
fcet training women's bodies don't

311
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,199
respond well to facet training what's

312
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:34,279
fcet training I don't even know what the

313
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:36,560
heck this is like fcet training fcet

314
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,839
training means you're not having any

315
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,480
food before you go do exercise oh so

316
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,959
well that's what I would always do like

317
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:43,440
I would always literally like I'm going

318
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,880
to eat after because my husband would

319
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,240
eat after and then we would my mouth is

320
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,000
on the floor you can see this on YouTube

321
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,760
but like as you're listening I'm I'm

322
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,760
processing this because I'm thinking how

323
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,639
often I've been pissed off at Chris my

324
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:00,440
husband yeah because will take on some

325
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,800
challenge together and I'm like this is

326
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,040
not fair like how is it that this is

327
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,839
actually making you lose weight and I

328
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:08,720
feel like I'm puffier and fluffier and

329
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,240
tired and pissed off yep and I'm

330
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,160
following the same steps I'm doing the

331
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,000
intermittent fasting I'm not eating

332
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,920
beforehand I'm slamming the thing after

333
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,480
I'm doing and I'm like what the hell is

334
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,000
going on and it this is because he's

335
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,519
male and I'm female yep exactly and it

336
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,680
comes really to the brain right so when

337
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,279
we start looking just at first thing you

338
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:30,320
get up and and our responses are

339
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,880
different where women's Brains will

340
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,680
start going okay where's the food to

341
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,399
come in to help bring my stress hormones

342
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,120
down and get me started for the day okay

343
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,160
and Men by the nature of being XY their

344
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,040
brain's like eh okay I'm going to supply

345
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,440
some amino acids and some blood sugar

346
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,920
and let's get on with the day then we'll

347
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,680
find some food that's fine but women's

348
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,199
brain specifically what we call the

349
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,079
hypothalamus that is really sensitive to

350
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,120
blood sugar and food coming in so if you

351
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,320
get up and you start your your exercise

352
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,440
without any food the hypothalamus is

353
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,680
like wait a second this is a stress to

354
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,560
the body that I need to really try to

355
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,839
figure out but if I don't have food to

356
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,000
counter the fuel that the muscles are

357
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,240
needing from a contraction I need to

358
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,600
find a way to supply that fuel so it

359
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,759
goes into a little bit of a tizzy and

360
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,199
one of the first things that starts to

361
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,000
get broken down is your muscle M cuz

362
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,720
muscle is a pretty active tissue and the

363
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,160
hypothalamus is like well I don't know

364
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,279
if I'm going to be able to supply the

365
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,800
food that this muscle needs if I don't

366
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,199
have any food coming in so it's a very

367
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:44,040
small amount of food that a woman needs

368
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,519
first thing in the morning to then go be

369
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,600
successful in her training and it's even

370
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,959
if you're going for a walk a lot of

371
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,800
women will get up and go for a walk on

372
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,959
the ospice are you with me like I are

373
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,360
you in my house with me maybe Stacy I'm

374
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,120
I'm sitting here thinking to myself S I

375
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,120
think a lifetime of messaging about like

376
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,680
thin is preferable yeah and that I want

377
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,040
to maximize calories burned so I'm going

378
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,440
to get up and I'm G to have a cup of

379
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,120
coffee because I'm tired and I'm going

380
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,279
to wire myself and then I you know back

381
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,800
in the day would be going for a run or

382
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,199
going to some sort of like Fitness class

383
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,839
uh you know I'm old enough to have been

384
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,480
doing step aerobics and everything else

385
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,519
let's go um

386
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,440
and now and and I've just carried that

387
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,920
over yeah and I also then tell myself a

388
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,240
story that I'm G to get a cramp or I'm

389
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,319
gonna like want to throw up in my mouth

390
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:41,920
if I'm doing something too much and I've

391
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,199
had too much to eat and so this is a

392
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:47,959
complete Le different change for me yeah

393
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:49,839
and it's one that's going to be really

394
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,639
super beneficial so every woman

395
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:56,880
listening and every woman in your life

396
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,040
if you're listening and your male needs

397
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,759
to know that one of the biggest mistakes

398
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,720
that we're making by following male

399
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,480
Centric Fitness advice is we need as

400
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,399
women biologically and physiologically

401
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:11,000
speaking to actually have something to

402
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,480
eat first thing when we get up yes yes

403
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,519
and when we start looking at it I've I

404
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,199
did a competition a couple of weekends

405
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,800
ago just for fun and I had so many women

406
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,480
come up and go the first thing that you

407
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,519
did to change my life was to tell me to

408
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,920
eat beforehand and now like my

409
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,680
training's better my outcomes are better

410
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,079
I have more energy and I'm like well of

411
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,639
course cuz your brain is like I can

412
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:36,720
handle this stress so if you are

413
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,040
supplying fuel to the empty tank of

414
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,519
course you're going to go far if you

415
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:43,360
think about trying to drive a car and

416
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,480
rev it up and get it on the highway to

417
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,360
at speed with it on E it's not going to

418
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,680
get very far so I try to explain to

419
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,839
women if you're going to get up and even

420
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,600
if you're going for a walk like you want

421
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,480
to maximize what you're doing you want

422
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,360
your metabolism to fire on all cylinders

423
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,240
you want to get some aerobic fitness

424
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,039
through that you need to supply just a

425
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,559
little bit of fuel and it doesn't mean a

426
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,799
full meal it could be the protein coffee

427
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:11,240
it could be a couple of tablespoons of

428
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,000
yogurt a half a banana it's not a lot

429
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,480
but it's enough to bring your blood

430
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,280
sugar up and tell your brain yeah I I've

431
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,919
got this I've got this so the first

432
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,720
change already small change but critical

433
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,240
one for our biology and Physiology is

434
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,039
you need to eat something before you

435
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,320
move or exercise in the morning yeah and

436
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,039
to also I think like the bigger thing

437
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,919
here for me is that I'm starting to

438
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,960
realize I've been so brainwashed about

439
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,679
the fact that you need to be thin yes

440
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:45,880
that it's a paradigm shift to actually

441
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,200
think well wait a minute I need to learn

442
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,720
how to work with my body and my natural

443
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,440
wiring to make it work for me and to

444
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,799
actually

445
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,240
optimize the way that my body's designed

446
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,000
as a woman right and one of the things

447
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,640
that um has come up recently in

448
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,679
conversations where uh some women who've

449
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,039
just started into strength training

450
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,080
realm or have dropped all of their you

451
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,080
know big cardio walking because we all

452
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,159
come from the 80s and 90s of let's do 90

453
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:18,440
minutes of aerobics and and that's not

454
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,200
appropriate so they've gotten out of

455
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,799
that mentality but they'll see other

456
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,280
women at the gym who are on the litical

457
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,640
or treadmill or out running and they

458
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,880
look really lean m and they're like well

459
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,039
I don't understand I kind of want to

460
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:34,280
look like that but I know that I need to

461
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,919
be doing strength training so I'm

462
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,000
confused the women that are 40 plus who

463
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,240
are doing the cardio for the most part

464
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,760
they're going to be what we call skinny

465
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,000
fat so that means that they're not going

466
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,679
to have a lot of quality muscle there's

467
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,880
going to be a lot of of fatty tissue

468
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
within the muscle and their bones are

469
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,320
going to be like chalk because if we are

470
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,559
doing all that cardio work and we're not

471
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,559
looking at how our bodies are aging and

472
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,440
what we need we need the food before the

473
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,480
training we need to put in some strength

474
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,720
training then we're going to

475
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,919
continuously be breaking down the tissue

476
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:10,440
that we want to keep to age well so when

477
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,640
we're talking about that mentality of

478
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,880
well what do I do it's like these small

479
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,720
steps of yeah let's have some food

480
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,799
before let's look at how we are dosing

481
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,559
our exercise what kinds of intensities

482
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,120
let's bring in some strength training

483
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,360
because all of those are going to feed

484
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,320
forward to having our lean mass having

485
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,200
really strong bones having really good

486
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,000
neuroplasticity so that means how your

487
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,919
brain changes in a positive way so as we

488
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,280
age we don't get dementia so these are

489
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,280
all the things that I would rather women

490
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,520
focus on than the drive from the 9s to

491
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,760
be Kate Moss thin because on the outside

492
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,159
that drive to be super thin is killing

493
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:54,480
us on the inside wow you you mentioned

494
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,080
protein coffee yeah can you explain what

495
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,120
that is and how that might satisfy the

496
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,320
first takeaway which is eat before you

497
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,240
move in the morning yes so a lot of

498
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,919
women don't have an appetite first thing

499
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,799
in the morning I'm one of those but I

500
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:11,360
know that I need fuel so I'm very much a

501
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,360
espresso addict I love it and one of the

502
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,120
simple things that I do is I make a

503
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,480
double espresso at night and I mix some

504
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,240
protein powder into my alond milk or

505
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,520
whatever milk you want and then I put

506
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,000
the hot coffee in there and put it in

507
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,840
the fridge overnight and then it's my go

508
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,600
to first thing in the morning where then

509
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,039
I'm getting my 30 gr of protein I'm

510
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,080
getting my caffeine it tastes like a

511
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,799
latte I'm good to go and so that's a

512
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,039
first hit it's a first eating

513
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,240
opportunity to bring in some of that

514
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,960
protein that we need and if you're going

515
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,760
to go do any kind of exercise knowing

516
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,280
that exercise mutes your appetite then

517
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,520
it also helps with that recovery part

518
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,039
because you're going to have those amino

519
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,679
acid circulating your brain's going to

520
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:56,360
say hey yeah okay I've got stuff to

521
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,880
rebuild tissue so it's a really really

522
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,480
good way of being able to have what you

523
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,200
need without feeling over full and still

524
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,080
enjoying some of the good things of life

525
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,080
like coffee well you've changed my life

526
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,919
already yay because I've got two

527
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:13,360
takeaways the first one is and I still

528
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,640
want to stay on it so I actually

529
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,240
understand why eating first thing before

530
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,159
I move my body and having fuel first

531
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:23,720
thing in the morning is actually super

532
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,640
important and I want to unpack that a

533
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,080
little bit more but I want to hover on

534
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,480
the protein coffee because I'm drinking

535
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,240
it right

536
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,960
now you made me one in our studios here

537
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,640
in Boston this is going to change my

538
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,840
life and here's why I have struggled

539
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,159
forever since I've learned and a lot of

540
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,360
us are learning as women that focusing

541
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,679
on more protein and especially getting

542
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,880
protein first thing in the morning is

543
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,880
super important and I'm always

544
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,240
struggling with how the hell am I going

545
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,480
to get 30 grams of protein first thing

546
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,279
in the morning without choking down 10

547
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:57,360
egg whites and what do I do if I'm on

548
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,600
the go and what do I do if I'm tired of

549
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,440
eggs and what do I do if I don't have a

550
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,480
blender near me and my stuff what do I

551
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,039
like and so you literally took a scoop

552
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,400
of protein shoved it in milk put in

553
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,720
espresso stirred it up and put on ice it

554
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,240
tastes like a freaking milkshake and

555
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,960
what I love about this is that a I can

556
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,279
make it the night before B it's 30 grams

557
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:24,000
of protein in a cup which c means I

558
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,799
could even take this on the walk with me

559
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,200
I could take this in the car if I'm

560
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,000
dropping my kids off somewhere I could

561
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,240
make this on the road like this is such

562
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,559
an incredible tip so thank you for that

563
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,600
you're welcome what I want to do though

564
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,360
Dr Sims is you mentioned that when women

565
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,640
wake up our brains are different than

566
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,360
the guys and our

567
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,000
stress levels are higher and it is

568
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,520
important to understand that and to give

569
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,640
yourself a little bit of fuel MH what

570
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,279
happens in your

571
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,880
body if you do start eating breakfast in

572
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,600
the morning or you CU a lot of women

573
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,919
skip it a lot of women are now

574
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,760
intermittent fasting a lot of people are

575
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,360
waiting until noon a lot of people don't

576
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,559
want to eat before they exercise because

577
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,400
they don't want cramps or they like

578
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,520
actually want to maximize calorie burn

579
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,679
but what is the benefit to a woman in

580
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:16,400
particular first thing in the morning if

581
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,760
you give yourself fuel there's a few

582
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,960
things to unpack there so first we look

583
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,000
at eating opportunities because there's

584
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,679
so many women who are one trying to lose

585
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:29,799
weight or two or in the fitness space

586
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:31,640
and following some of the trends that

587
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,799
don't eat enough so if you aren't eating

588
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,480
enough you're not going to actually

589
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,600
change your body composition so we look

590
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,240
at eating opportunities first thing in

591
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,279
the morning 30 grams of protein boom

592
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:44,840
that's an eating opportunity that you're

593
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,840
not really feeling overly full but it's

594
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,880
such a great benefit to the body and

595
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,120
you're ahead of the game by having 30

596
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,520
grams of protein we also look at some of

597
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,799
the newer research that's coming out

598
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,559
about our circadian rhythms or how how

599
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,720
our body goes through 24-hour cycle and

600
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,200
for people who break their fast by

601
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,279
around 8:00 a.m. and then they don't eat

602
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,880
after 6:00 p.m. have all these great

603
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,720
metabolic outcomes that you would expect

604
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,080
from quote intermittent fasting but we

605
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,080
see that people who hold a fast till

606
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,120
noon or after don't get any of that

607
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,360
benefit so if we look well why why is

608
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,960
that we have to understand that half an

609
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,440
hour after a woman wakes up we have a

610
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,360
spike in cortisol that's our stress

611
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,240
hormone if we don't have food to tell

612
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,240
the brain to drop that then we stay in

613
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,360
this heightened stress State and what

614
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,240
cortisol is responsible for is that

615
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,880
fight or flight but also providing fuel

616
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,120
for being able to fight or flight so the

617
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,640
first thing that goes is we start

618
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,039
chewing into our lean mass which is bone

619
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:53,279
and muscle and a signal to keep our body

620
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,039
fat especially as we start to get older

621
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:59,480
wait a minute so not eating

622
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,159
and not eating because you think it's

623
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:03,799
going to help you lose weight actually

624
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:05,520
counterproductive it's counterproductive

625
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,080
because it's signaling your body to stay

626
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,679
in fight or flight which makes your body

627
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:12,559
hold on to Fat yes are you kidding me no

628
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,520
I mean when we look at the trends of the

629
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,720
fasted training don't eat be it's all on

630
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,360
male data and the difference between men

631
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,520
and women in the situation is again it

632
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,080
comes down to the brain so a man can get

633
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,320
by with the fasted training because when

634
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,679
when we're looking at getting up and

635
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,000
holding a fast or going training without

636
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,559
food for a man's body it stimulates the

637
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,559
little molecular structures in the

638
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:43,240
muscles to use more fat because their

639
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,000
muscle structure and the types of fibers

640
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,559
that they have are different than

641
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:49,960
women's so men have what we call more

642
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,080
glycolytic or fibers that use glucose

643
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,679
and not as many oxidative or the fibers

644
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,840
that use fat as a fuel women we're born

645
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,919
with more of those oxidative fat burning

646
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:05,960
fibers so when we go and we don't

647
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,240
provide fuel the body's like I'm going

648
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,320
to store fat because I'm going to need

649
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,880
it because that's the preferred fuel for

650
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,480
your muscles so men's bodies will start

651
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,240
to adapt to be able to use more fat

652
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,360
which is why you see fasting and holding

653
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,159
a fast working so well in men but for

654
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:25,480
women it doesn't do the same because we

655
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,279
have different feedback mechanisms from

656
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,600
the brain we have different muscle

657
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,559
requirements because of different

658
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,039
morphology we call it or different

659
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,760
muscle fiber types so this is where you

660
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,360
know we start looking at all the stuff

661
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,760
that we've been trained to do over the

662
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,600
decades and how counterproductive and

663
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,240
harmful it can be for women who are

664
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,960
trying to improve body composition and

665
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,039
Bone wow now does eating first thing in

666
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,399
the morning because you mentioned the

667
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:54,640
Circadian rhythm for a woman also help

668
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,919
you sleep better at night absolutely how

669
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:58,600
come because if we're look looking at

670
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,919
decreasing our overall stress response

671
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,760
so that cortisol bringing the cortisol

672
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,440
down over the course of time you're

673
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,000
going to have a lower Baseline of that

674
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,440
cortisol if you have a lower Baseline of

675
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,600
cortisol then your body can get into

676
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,640
what we call parasympathetic so that's

677
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,720
what you need to sleep if you have this

678
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,520
high elevation of cortisol all the time

679
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,200
we're always sympathetically wired so we

680
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,399
can't get into deep reparative sleep so

681
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:25,520
you see a lot of Awakenings the other

682
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,520
thing that happens when women frontload

683
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,880
their Foods so we have a lot of of our

684
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,919
calories in the day which we should then

685
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:35,679
when we go to sleep we aren't waking up

686
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,840
with hypoglycemia that means we're not

687
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,960
waking up with low blood sugar because a

688
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,200
lot of women who undereat or hold a fast

689
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,000
and they aren't eating enough their

690
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,480
Awakenings at night is due to low blood

691
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,080
sugar I thought it was because I had to

692
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,360
pee it's also because of the low blood

693
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,559
sugar Doctor S where the hell have you

694
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,399
been like I I needed you in my life like

695
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:00,279
decades ago I needed me then too it's

696
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,440
taken me this long to be able to acquire

697
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,080
all the knowledge and the research so

698
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,200
now I'm hoping that we can hit all of

699
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,960
the listeners and so that they will

700
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,360
learn what we should have known decades

701
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,919
ago this is so eye opening like already

702
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:15,640
you

703
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,360
have highlighted so many differences

704
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,760
between men and women just in the

705
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,880
morning just in the stress levels just

706
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,120
in the fuel that we need in the morning

707
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,919
in the muscle comp composition like all

708
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,000
of it and it also is very Illuminating

709
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,120
because it makes a lot of sense then as

710
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,440
to why the programs that work for Chris

711
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,760
and seem to work like magic actually

712
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,840
leave me frustrated and tired yeah so

713
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,440
what would be the ideal breakfast for

714
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,320
anyone whether like and let's just talk

715
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,080
about the person who just wants to move

716
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,440
more they want to take better care of

717
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,159
their body they want to understand how

718
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:55,679
their body works so that you're getting

719
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,039
better results and you're feeling better

720
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,640
in your life so what would breakfast

721
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,080
look like just on an average morning if

722
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,159
you know for anybody yeah that I will

723
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:08,799
say that it's a hard one because people

724
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,320
have different food preferences how

725
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,159
about an avatar what's an avatar a a

726
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:15,000
makeup person okay a makeup person

727
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,559
makeup person so we'll say there's a

728
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:19,799
woman who is plant-based but not

729
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,080
vegetarian know so she has a preference

730
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,120
for plants three kids you know super

731
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,240
busy wakes up has been waking up tired

732
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,039
but wired didn't sleep well was like

733
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,600
okay I need to make this change never

734
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,600
hungry in the morning so we can split

735
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,519
her breakfast it could be overnight oats

736
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:38,679
which is chiaia seeds oatmeal some um

737
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:41,960
milk or or oat milk to soak it then when

738
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,279
she gets up she's like I'm going to

739
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,919
split that in half the first half I'm

740
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,159
going to add some berries and maybe

741
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,360
another tablespoon of Greek yogurt CU

742
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,080
then I'm going to get some protein

743
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,320
carbohydrate some Fiber and it's going

744
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,559
to calm me down it's going to tell my

745
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:58,840
brain yep ready to go okay then

746
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,720
you either are going out for your walk

747
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,799
maybe you're going to do some home

748
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,559
strength training maybe you're meeting a

749
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,480
friend for a session maybe you're taking

750
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,600
15 minutes of Just Breath work to to

751
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,760
bring yourself down especially if you're

752
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,559
the Avatar of three kids in a busy life

753
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,480
just taking that moment to put yourself

754
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,320
first and then when you get back maybe

755
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,120
it's an hour hour and a half later you

756
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,159
have the second half the second half of

757
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:27,360
those overnight oats with a few more

758
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,360
tablespoons of Greek yogurt and some

759
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,720
nuts and berries because then you're

760
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,519
getting the protein carbohydrate so

761
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:34,760
you've actually split your breakfast but

762
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,760
you've given your body the benefit of

763
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,360
food on different eating opportunities

764
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,720
without being over full but at the end

765
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,159
you end up with 30 grams of protein over

766
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,799
the course of a couple of hours so it's

767
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,880
easy you can mix it up do it the night

768
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,360
before you know that I'm not that hungry

769
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,640
but if I have a little bit and then over

770
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,360
the course of a couple of weeks you're

771
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,559
going to find that you're going to wake

772
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:00,240
up go yeah I need some food and this is

773
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,200
kind of a reset of your circadian rhythm

774
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,320
your body is starting to fall in line

775
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,840
your hypothalamus is understanding your

776
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,760
appetite hormones are starting to work

777
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,799
properly and when all of that feeds

778
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,760
forward then you're going to start to

779
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,880
see changes in body composition because

780
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,480
you're having better sleep because we

781
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,600
can't change anything if our sleep is

782
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,200
perturbed so the more we focus on how

783
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,039
are we going to work with our body's

784
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:26,279
natural rhythms and the way that our

785
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:29,240
hormones work the the more it feeds into

786
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,799
better parasympathetic drive for better

787
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:34,559
sleep I have just so screwed this up

788
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,720
like I literally wake up I delay the

789
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,919
coffee I exercise on an empty stomach I

790
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,039
then have my coffee which I'm then

791
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:44,080
drinking on an empty stomach which means

792
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,600
I've now maximized stressing myself out

793
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,840
and then I'm slamming something that has

794
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,919
30 45 grams of protein after I work out

795
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,360
and so what have you done if you are the

796
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,919
kind of person like I am that you've

797
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,600
bought into all the BS and you've

798
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,399
basically been starving yourself in the

799
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,039
morning and even if you get out for a

800
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,240
walk how are you kind of actually not

801
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,880
only not getting the benefit but you're

802
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,320
making it worse what's happening in like

803
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,679
the person's body when you do not feed

804
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,360
yourself first thing in the morning as a

805
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,080
woman yeah I always bring it down to

806
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,039
what are we doing when when we want to

807
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,519
exercise right we're looking for better

808
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,399
blood glucose control we're looking for

809
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:29,120
better bone we're looking for better

810
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,320
muscle if you're not eating then you are

811
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,039
not going to get better at any of that

812
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:36,440
stuff because the body again is like I

813
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,639
need fuel for the stress that's

814
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:41,159
occurring and I need fuel for the

815
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,399
exercise so if you've been brainwashed

816
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:45,799
like I am MH and you're exercising

817
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,760
because you are trying to like lose

818
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,880
weight or you're trying to look thin

819
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,360
MH what is happening if I continue to go

820
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,159
down that route where I don't eat before

821
00:32:57,159 --> 00:32:59,200
I exercise and I'm basically starving

822
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,639
myself and I'm going for my walk and I'm

823
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:05,080
delaying food you lose muscle and then

824
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,840
the other thing when we look at women

825
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,080
who are late 30s early 40s onwards we

826
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,320
get a signal to put on more visceral fat

827
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,519
so that's that deep belly fat that that

828
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,159
metabolically active that can be

829
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,519
dangerous so I'll see women who are at

830
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,039
you know doing the same Pursuit and

831
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:23,120
really proud of the fact that they're

832
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,559
intermittent fasting they're not

833
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,480
breaking their fast till noon they've

834
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,880
had their coffee to hold them through

835
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,200
and you do a DEA and what's a DEA a DEA

836
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,519
is when you go and you get a complete

837
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:36,919
body scan so it looks at your muscle it

838
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:39,320
looks at fat where Fat's put it looks at

839
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,039
how dense your bones are so we see their

840
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:43,840
dexa results and on the outside they

841
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,080
look healthy right but on the inside

842
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,639
it's a bit of a scary story where we see

843
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:53,720
low bone density we see an increase of

844
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,559
fat accumulating in the belly area which

845
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,559
means that it's more what we call

846
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,720
metabolically active so you see a change

847
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,880
in your um cholesterol so you have more

848
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,519
of the quote bad cholesterol that's

849
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:06,600
elevated you have more inflammatory

850
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,200
markers which is a predisposition for

851
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,560
diabetes we see insulin resistance so I

852
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,440
know that there are listeners and maybe

853
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,520
you know you're thinking about well I've

854
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,919
been doing this forever and I don't have

855
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:22,079
any bad blood markers what's going on I

856
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,000
didn't say that it necessarily comes out

857
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,119
that's the worst case scenario but when

858
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:27,399
we look at what's happening on the

859
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,240
inside side I don't want your bones to

860
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,440
be like chalk and I don't want you not

861
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,079
to have muscle to be able to get up and

862
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,639
run after your grandkids or carry your

863
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,800
groceries into your house so if we just

864
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,760
make that Small Change by having some

865
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,960
food first thing and then carrying on

866
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,760
with your day you're going to get the

867
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,760
impetus to build muscle you're going to

868
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,040
get the impetus to keep your bone and

869
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,280
you're going to be able to reduce the

870
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,440
signaling for that deep belly fat and

871
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,280
it's all those Health like I understand

872
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,760
it I've been there I grew up in that

873
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,920
same 1980s 1990s and I still get it in

874
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,880
my head sometimes like well is this the

875
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,359
right thing and I'm I've done the

876
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:10,599
research I've been in the lab I've

877
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:12,920
implemented it so it is really difficult

878
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,720
to get your head around yeah but you

879
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,000
have to look at the long terms like

880
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,720
where do you want to be in 5 years 10

881
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,680
years 15 years from now well and I also

882
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,040
think it's just like if you actually are

883
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,440
working out not only to take care of

884
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,240
yourself but because you do want to

885
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,200
change the composition of your body you

886
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,880
do want to be a little leaner you do

887
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,280
want to be stronger that focusing on the

888
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,240
actual science and this is like a

889
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,079
complete turnaround for me that you need

890
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,800
to actually eat more yes in order to

891
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,599
lose exactly which is the exact opposite

892
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,800
of the brainwashing that all women and

893
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,640
girls have have received for their

894
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:54,280
entire life right and so it's so helpful

895
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,880
to hear you talk about the science and

896
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,640
it makes so much sense because I think

897
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,839
we've all had that experience in our

898
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:03,440
life we're like I am trying and this

899
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,319
isn't working right and the first

900
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:08,680
mistake that I've been making for now 56

901
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,079
years I'm understanding is literally not

902
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:14,280
eating before I exercise yeah and you

903
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,200
know one thing I want to ask is does

904
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,640
this work for everyone you know I got

905
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,680
this listener question because when

906
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,319
people found out that you were coming oh

907
00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:24,720
my God it was like our website crashed

908
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,640
Ruby wrote in why do some people have

909
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,640
natural muscle tone and some of us can

910
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,079
eat right work out and we are still

911
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:35,520
flabby and not

912
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,200
toned there are lots of things on this

913
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,319
and I wish that Ruby was in this room

914
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:42,800
because then I could say well let's look

915
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,960
at um your morphology so your body type

916
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,680
so there are some women who have a

917
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,839
better predisposition for building

918
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:52,520
muscle we call those mesomorphic and

919
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,400
then we have other women who struggle

920
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,119
really hard to put muscle Mass on and

921
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:00,280
they tend to be a little bit flaber and

922
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,480
that is more of our endomorphic and then

923
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,920
we have in the middle the ectomorphic

924
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,880
that are the super skinny K moss and

925
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,200
most of the time people are a mix of

926
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,839
that okay so when we look at those

927
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,240
different muscle types and you're

928
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,240
looking at doing all the work and not

929
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,400
getting any benefit I want to see what

930
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,560
kind of training you're doing because if

931
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,960
we are looking at when you're eating and

932
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,680
how you're complimenting your exercise

933
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,760
then we can make gains and every woman's

934
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,920
a little bit different like my sister

935
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,880
she isn't so into Athletics and stuff

936
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,680
that I am we grew up in the same

937
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,839
household but I was always out building

938
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:38,760
tree forts and she was in reading books

939
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,400
uhhuh but over the past year she's

940
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,200
really put herself into getting stronger

941
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,960
and strength training body composition

942
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,920
is changing her grip strength is

943
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,839
stronger and she's like I never really

944
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:53,000
thought that lifting weights would help

945
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,960
me change my body composition I was like

946
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,480
why have you not thought of that like if

947
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,000
if you're lifting under load you build

948
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,240
muscle she's like but then that's weight

949
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,000
on the scale and I was always afraid of

950
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,680
the weight on the scale not the outcome

951
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,280
of looking better right and then we also

952
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,200
because we've been so gaslit to think

953
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,079
that it's about being so thin right that

954
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:15,520
and that's what's desirable that you

955
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,640
hear build muscle and you're like but I

956
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,000
don't want to bulk up I'm actually

957
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,079
trying to lean down yeah and what you're

958
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:22,920
saying is no no no this is actually like

959
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,960
putting on your own Spanx with your

960
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,960
muscles right it tightens you up right

961
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,560
and I will say like I sit here and I

962
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,720
know people always comment about my

963
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,160
arms and it takes a lot of work to get

964
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,079
arms like that I would think yeah but

965
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:39,200
the other thing is I they're amazing

966
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,280
arms thanks I I'm wearing a long sleeve

967
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,440
shirt for a

968
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,640
reason if I had your arms I'd be wearing

969
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,240
a tank top too I would love it if all of

970
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,200
this would go lower body like I have

971
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,440
tried for years to get really strong

972
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,520
hamstrings and really strong glutes

973
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,200
they're strong but they're not bulky

974
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,280
it's just mesomorphic up here

975
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,160
ectomorphic down so it's the difference

976
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,160
in the

977
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,520
combination um but I went through a time

978
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,400
where I was really upset with the fact

979
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,599
that I had more muscle like when I was

980
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,200
bike racing I tried really really hard

981
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,599
to lose it but I couldn't because my

982
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:22,160
body's like no this is how you are born

983
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,760
so women who are like I'm really trying

984
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,400
to build muscle it doesn't necessarily

985
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,040
mean you're going to get bulky

986
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,200
if you don't have a genetic

987
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,160
predisposition for putting muscle on

988
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,400
really really easily it's really hard to

989
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,440
get bulky and for most women who are

990
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,000
trying to put muscle on not eating or

991
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,480
doing lots of cardio work you're not

992
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,520
going to put muscle on it's really hard

993
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,480
to get

994
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,480
bulky so what do you want everyone to

995
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,200
know about exercise as opposed to diet

996
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,040
ah so when we look at all the diet

997
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,800
trends that are out there right we see

998
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,560
the plant face the carnivorous the keto

999
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,359
the intermittent fasting all of the

1000
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:05,640
things they are born out of a Want For

1001
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,960
Better Health body composition better

1002
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,920
gut all of those things but if you

1003
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,040
exercise then you get all of those

1004
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,119
things and wait say that again yeah okay

1005
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,920
so hold on a second so all of those

1006
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,760
diets are designed to try to create a

1007
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,119
health outcome through eating yes but if

1008
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:32,200
you exercise the exercise provides the

1009
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,520
health outcome yes because we look at

1010
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,280
exercis as a stress like we have gotten

1011
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,319
into a societal idea that we all live in

1012
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,720
the same kind of temperature we have

1013
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,280
automatic garage door openers we have

1014
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,520
the internet we have our computers even

1015
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,480
driverless cars so we have created this

1016
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,640
environment where we don't move the

1017
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,200
outcome of having a environment where we

1018
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,960
don't move we don't have a lot of green

1019
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,240
space or opportunities to even walk

1020
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,960
places is now we have this obesity

1021
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,839
epidemic and even if you're not facing

1022
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,359
obesity you're facing some

1023
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:09,720
overweightness and you're being

1024
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,319
bombarded by all these diet

1025
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:15,040
Styles if we were just to put a pause on

1026
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,520
the diet style and just take a step back

1027
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,000
and say you know what if I go back to

1028
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,520
eating normally which means that I'm

1029
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,680
eating breakfast lunch dinner and I'm

1030
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,079
not eating snacks after dinner and I'm

1031
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,839
kind of paying attention to kind of food

1032
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,960
that I'm eating so it's nutrient dense

1033
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,760
it's not all these ultr processed things

1034
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,720
there's no protein Pop-Tarts CU it says

1035
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,480
protein on it you know what I call this

1036
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,160
Dr Sims the grandparent diet yes okay

1037
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,160
basically how your grandparents lived

1038
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,800
right exactly and then you put in some

1039
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,960
exercise because exercise is a stress

1040
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,640
the body is very adaptable to stress so

1041
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,960
if we're looking at doing a longer

1042
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,280
harder walk up a hill after a couple of

1043
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,640
weeks of doing that it's going to be

1044
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,359
easy cuz your body's adapted to that

1045
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:03,760
stress oh we call it getting fitter but

1046
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,880
actually your body has adapted all of

1047
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,760
its mechanisms to that stress so if

1048
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,560
we're looking at how do I get a better

1049
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,200
okay hold on a second so I just had this

1050
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,359
like Epiphany okay I can't believe how

1051
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,440
many bombs you're dropping today like I

1052
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,920
I I I've never thought about exercise

1053
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,880
that way because I've focused on you

1054
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,119
have to exercise to get in better shape

1055
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:30,400
what you're saying is exercise is

1056
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,240
intentionally moving and stressing your

1057
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,760
body in a way that it needs and is

1058
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,160
designed to do yeah and in response to

1059
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,680
the stress your body gets stronger at

1060
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,800
being able to manage stress exactly oh

1061
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,359
my God it's a stress resilience and the

1062
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,200
reason why we're so flabby and

1063
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,359
everything else is because we're sitting

1064
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:53,920
around and not moving and not stressing

1065
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,920
our bodies in the way that we need to

1066
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,760
and that only makes us more stressed out

1067
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,319
right because we look at stress mental

1068
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,800
health all of the things that are really

1069
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,280
plaguing everyone and the part of it is

1070
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,119
lack of community lack of empathy all of

1071
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,200
these things that breed depression

1072
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,480
mental health and the fact that we

1073
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,559
aren't moving our bodies there's so much

1074
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:19,480
research out there that says if you go

1075
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,319
for a walk you're you are reducing

1076
00:43:23,319 --> 00:43:26,119
stress if you go for a walk and you

1077
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:28,319
actually go to a green space so that's

1078
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,280
to a park and you're in nature it

1079
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,880
induces an incredible parasympathetic

1080
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,720
response which means that you reduce

1081
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,520
stress but because we are so ingrained

1082
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,920
to doing all the things all the time

1083
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,359
inside sitting and not actually getting

1084
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,119
outside having the fresh air having that

1085
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:48,079
connection with being outside and moving

1086
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,640
our bodies we are by Design now a global

1087
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,559
of very stressed out unempathetic

1088
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:58,280
depressed people and if we're talking

1089
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,319
about how do we just make one small

1090
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,839
change to improve our mental health

1091
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:06,000
that's exercise I'm not necessarily here

1092
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,079
as an exercise physiologist to tell you

1093
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,640
the listener to go out and go for a long

1094
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,720
hard walk because you want better body

1095
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,839
composition I'm here as an exercise

1096
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,119
physiologist to explain what exercise is

1097
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,680
it is an incredible positive stress on

1098
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,160
the body that creates changes from

1099
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,000
central nervous system down to the

1100
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,800
smallest little thing in your cell to

1101
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,079
improve your overall stress resilience

1102
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,079
and Metabolism meaning how your body

1103
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:38,400
handles food how your brain reacts to

1104
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,599
stress how your brain perceives an

1105
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,200
environment and you just the moving part

1106
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,839
really does help bring Center and bring

1107
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:52,000
yourself back to you I believe it and I

1108
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,559
want to see if I can

1109
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:58,359
just use an example to try to to really

1110
00:44:58,359 --> 00:44:59,880
paint the picture of what you're

1111
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,599
teaching us right now which is an

1112
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:05,400
entirely different way to think about

1113
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,800
the importance of movement and exercise

1114
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,240
strength training whatever it is that

1115
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,400
you're going to do MH when you go for a

1116
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,319
walk and let's say you go for a walk and

1117
00:45:15,319 --> 00:45:16,800
you were mentioning you go for a walk

1118
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,920
and there's a hill in your neighborhood

1119
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,040
and when you have to go up the hill

1120
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,160
we've all experienced this you get

1121
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,760
shortness of breath you got to be using

1122
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,559
your legs a little bit more to go up the

1123
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:29,839
incline mhm make it a little winded a

1124
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,160
little sweaty yep even if you got a dog

1125
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,880
on a leash pulling you up the hill like

1126
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,160
you're going and that is you by

1127
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,640
exercising your body putting yourself in

1128
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,480
a stressful situation right because it's

1129
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,160
requiring your body to exert effort and

1130
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,920
to move against that incline and it's

1131
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,040
designed to do that yeah and if you keep

1132
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,880
doing that over time what you're

1133
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,760
actually doing in addition to all the

1134
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,480
positive things that happen is you're

1135
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,160
training your

1136
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,319
body on how to be strong in situations

1137
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:09,119
that are stressful right so the more

1138
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,319
that you walk and the more that you

1139
00:46:11,319 --> 00:46:13,280
build muscle and the more that you take

1140
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,800
the advice that you're about to give us

1141
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,319
about what we should specifically be

1142
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,359
doing as women fast forward six months

1143
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,319
from now if you keep doing that and

1144
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:23,800
you're sitting in a stressful meeting at

1145
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,280
work the impact of that outside stress

1146
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,839
on you is going to be way less because

1147
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:31,800
you and your life have been

1148
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,960
strengthening your body by going to the

1149
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,480
gym and going for a walk so that your

1150
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,960
body can actually be in stressful

1151
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,680
situations and not get hijacked exactly

1152
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,839
so the whole flight or fight response

1153
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:46,119
that people talk about with cortisol

1154
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:48,359
we're flighting we're teaching our body

1155
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:50,880
that flight by exercising and your

1156
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,800
body's like this is a stress I need to

1157
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,000
understand it overcome it get stronger

1158
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,400
could also think about it as the fight

1159
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,480
response too cuz if you're in the gym

1160
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,400
and you're building the muscle and

1161
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,760
you're ready to go coiled up ready to go

1162
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,760
your body's learning that stress because

1163
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,200
it's we're not an algorithm we adapt to

1164
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,480
so many different things so if we put

1165
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,720
our body into an uncomfortable or a

1166
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,559
challenged situation doesn't like it so

1167
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:19,839
it learns how to overcome that and get

1168
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,599
stronger in the process so when I you

1169
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:24,640
know as you're explaining it's like yes

1170
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,240
it's all about stress resilience we're

1171
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,440
resilient to stress in a meeting our

1172
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,559
immune system is also really resilient

1173
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:33,880
to stuff that's going around and we're

1174
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,280
also resilient enough to maintain a

1175
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,040
focus if we're getting ready to lose it

1176
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,880
and our kid goes off like we're not

1177
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,280
going to break down and start yelling at

1178
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,119
our partner or our kid because we have

1179
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,520
the stress resilience we're able to take

1180
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,520
that

1181
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,040
pause it makes so much sense and you

1182
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,880
know you've talked a lot about strength

1183
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,839
training why is strength training so

1184
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,440
important for women in

1185
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,920
particular yeah I wish I had known about

1186
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,880
strength training way back when like I

1187
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,800
was introduced to it when I was 16

1188
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,520
because my friend's brother was a

1189
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,640
bodybuilder and I was like oh okay I'll

1190
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,480
go cuz Michelle you're going I'll go

1191
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,119
with you but I didn't really realize

1192
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:14,920
what that meant so when we talk about

1193
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,640
the science of strength training right

1194
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,839
now we know that with age we lose muscle

1195
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:21,839
really quickly start to lose it when we

1196
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,839
hit 30 and it's really important because

1197
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:27,400
one it's an active tissue so it helps

1198
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,200
maintain so many different systems in

1199
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,400
our body not only that but we think

1200
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,079
about strength training and how it um

1201
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,960
puts leverage on the bone to improve

1202
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,319
bone but the big thing really is when we

1203
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:41,839
think about cognitive decline so we see

1204
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,400
that there's a sex difference as we get

1205
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,839
older in Alzheimer's dementia cognitive

1206
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:49,839
decline and it has to do with brain

1207
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,160
brain metabolism so that's the fuel that

1208
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,680
your brain uses and what we call

1209
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:58,280
neuroplasticity or how your brain

1210
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,119
adapts and creates neural Pathways if

1211
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,000
we're strength training then we yeah

1212
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,359
we're taking care of our bone and a

1213
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,240
muscle but it's creating signals to the

1214
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,280
brain to increase its ability to be

1215
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,480
really plastic so it's like yeah okay I

1216
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,839
need to have a new PA pathway let's

1217
00:49:16,839 --> 00:49:19,240
develop that pathway and so it's always

1218
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,559
changing it's like sidoku right you're

1219
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:23,680
mentally working on that but strength

1220
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,359
training does the same thing but it also

1221
00:49:26,359 --> 00:49:29,000
Improv improves overall metabolism so

1222
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,520
now your brain is very flexible and it's

1223
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,319
like okay well I need glucose but then I

1224
00:49:33,319 --> 00:49:35,480
can use lactate so when you start doing

1225
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,920
all of these things it reduces your

1226
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,720
chances of developing cognitive issues

1227
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,799
so for women I'm always like yeah

1228
00:49:44,799 --> 00:49:46,559
strength training is great because we're

1229
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,480
building all these things we're changing

1230
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,040
our body composition but for the long

1231
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,640
term we want to have a good body and a

1232
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,119
good mind so for doing these things and

1233
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,240
creating more Pathways and

1234
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,359
developing existing Pathways and making

1235
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:03,079
the brain very responsive and able to be

1236
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:05,040
flexible then we're going to have a

1237
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,839
really good sound mind when we're all

1238
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:10,040
doing Zimmer frame races when we're 100

1239
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,559
what are Zimmer frame races you know

1240
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:14,119
those frames that old women have to use

1241
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:16,280
and or old men I've never seen those I

1242
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,240
don't know what you're talking about in

1243
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,880
the nursing homes you haven't seen those

1244
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,760
silver Walkers oh yes I thought that was

1245
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,160
a game you were talking about so the I

1246
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,000
have a feeling you're not going to be

1247
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,400
using a walker I have a feeling you're

1248
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,839
going the one teaching us all how to

1249
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,720
lift weights when we're 90 years old in

1250
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,559
the nursing home together well no I'll

1251
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:33,520
be using a Zimmer frame I'll be doing

1252
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,920
the races with everyone else because I

1253
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,160
can't say that my joints are all that

1254
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,119
great so what is the biology behind

1255
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:44,760
building muscle and how is it different

1256
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,720
for men versus women like what do women

1257
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,480
need to know women are what we call more

1258
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,559
fatigue resistant so as I was describing

1259
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,559
earlier the differences in the muscle

1260
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,000
fiber types right so women have more of

1261
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,119
those fat burning we call endurant

1262
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:03,160
fibers so that means that you can do

1263
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,480
lots of work and then you recover

1264
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,400
relatively quickly so when we're looking

1265
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,240
at sets and Reps and things like that

1266
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,440
women don't need as much recovery time

1267
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,880
between your sets and Reps to be able to

1268
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,920
have the same kind of training stress

1269
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,680
now break that down please because I

1270
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,319
don't know anything that you just talked

1271
00:51:21,319 --> 00:51:24,119
about I was like sets reps okay what are

1272
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:28,640
we doing so say have a man and a woman

1273
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,040
that go to the gym and they're like okay

1274
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:35,599
I'm supposed to do five sets so that's

1275
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,079
five sets so yeah this is there a lot I

1276
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:41,040
know it's an avatar here okay well let's

1277
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,720
just use an avatar of somebody who is

1278
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,200
just starting okay so like we're gonna

1279
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,280
like what's the bare minimum doctors I'm

1280
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,160
looking for something I can succeed at

1281
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,000
five sets sounds like a lot yeah I'll

1282
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,680
get to there but I want I wanted to

1283
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,680
explain the biology okay you tell me

1284
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,119
biology I'll give you the biology and

1285
00:51:58,119 --> 00:51:59,599
then I'll give you the actionable where

1286
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,599
to start thank you Dr SS all right so if

1287
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:03,200
we take a man and a woman they go to the

1288
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,960
gym and they have this the similar

1289
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,599
program where they're supposed to do

1290
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:09,119
five sets of five reps on the three

1291
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:10,720
minutes so what does that mean you do

1292
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,440
five reps of a squat in 3 minutes so

1293
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,440
however long it takes you to do those

1294
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,000
and then you rest the rest of the time

1295
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,440
for the 3 minutes okay so maybe it takes

1296
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,160
you 30 seconds to do your five squats

1297
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,720
and then you have 2 minutes and 30

1298
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,880
seconds to recover oh okay okay and you

1299
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,880
do that five times so that's 5 by five

1300
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,520
so if a man and a woman both do that and

1301
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,880
we look over time the strength the

1302
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,200
relative strength gain so that means

1303
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:41,000
relative to sex and body weight the man

1304
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,200
will acquire better strength gains in a

1305
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,280
woman but if we were to change that

1306
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,680
recovery for the woman to go five sets

1307
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,200
on 5x5 on the 2 minute so she does it in

1308
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:55,400
30 seconds and has a minute 30 recovery

1309
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,559
then over course of time she'll have the

1310
00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:01,000
same outcomes because her body is like I

1311
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,680
don't need as much rest so it starts to

1312
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,480
kind of downturn with so much rest so

1313
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,200
you can put more training stress on and

1314
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,760
less time as a woman wow so this is one

1315
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,119
of the things that we're starting to

1316
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:15,680
really discover in the strength training

1317
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,160
research because it's relatively new

1318
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,760
we're like okay we know that there's the

1319
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,920
sex differences in the muscle fiber

1320
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,960
types where women have more of these you

1321
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,720
know endurant type fibers men have more

1322
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,680
of the fast glycolytic fibers so if we

1323
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,720
really want to maximize the outcome of

1324
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,520
our strength training we need to work to

1325
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,680
women's physiology where they don't need

1326
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,680
as much rest to get the same kind of um

1327
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,400
stress and outcome and you know what I

1328
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,559
like about that it means it doesn't take

1329
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:43,680
as much time exactly I have a lot of

1330
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,079
time so that's very good news Dr Sims

1331
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:47,760
you know I'm about to ask you a bunch of

1332
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,040
questions about like the specifics of

1333
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,559
what we should be doing but I had one

1334
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:53,319
question you know whenever I'm

1335
00:53:53,319 --> 00:53:57,079
complaining about uh my body or you know

1336
00:53:57,079 --> 00:53:59,359
feeling out of shape or whatever it is

1337
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:02,040
that I want to change my husband always

1338
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,799
turns me and says well don't forget abs

1339
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:08,240
are built in the kitchen not in the gym

1340
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,119
yeah is this like a man's is that what

1341
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:13,040
works for men that works for men

1342
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:17,040
definitely yep because when I hear that

1343
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,839
abs are built in the kitchen not in the

1344
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:20,240
gym I'm like am I supposed to starve

1345
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,720
myself like what what are you talking

1346
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,720
about right so this comes back to the uh

1347
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,440
you know the fasting and I get really

1348
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,559
frustrated where men will drop alcohol

1349
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:31,760
they'll drop sugar and then all of a

1350
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,359
sudden their abs are ripped right they

1351
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:36,559
like belly fat gone yes but for women we

1352
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:39,000
tend to store belly fat correct and if

1353
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,599
I'm not drinking yeah I want results I

1354
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,319
know but it doesn't necessarily happen

1355
00:54:43,319 --> 00:54:45,920
no it doesn't Dr Sims it doesn't this is

1356
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,240
not fair no cuz I don't understand my

1357
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,880
own body I know it's very frustrating

1358
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,040
and I've been listening to the Bro

1359
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,720
Science and my stupid husband telling me

1360
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,240
the advice that works for him and he's

1361
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,200
he's only trying to help so what do I so

1362
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,480
why does it not work that way for women

1363
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,520
we have a higher percent body fat for

1364
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,200
one and again it comes down to food

1365
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,880
intake and hypothalamus so if we start

1366
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,640
taking out food and not replacing those

1367
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,359
calories with something else then we end

1368
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:15,720
up in a lower energy state so that's a

1369
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,240
that could be a whole another podcast

1370
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,040
but basically we're not eating enough to

1371
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,720
support body composition change and

1372
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,680
health outcomes so if we talk about ABS

1373
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,200
in the kitchen if we're eating the same

1374
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,960
kind of grandparent diet then we're

1375
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,920
going to have the same outcomes right

1376
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,400
but if we have the extra 20 bit of life

1377
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,799
where we're having chocolate and whiskey

1378
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:38,920
and all those fun things a man can take

1379
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,720
it out and get super ripped woman takes

1380
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,920
it out there's no

1381
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,720
change why because the hypothalamus is

1382
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,400
like where are those calories I need

1383
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,480
those calories so if we want to eat a

1384
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,880
little bit cleaner we have to make sure

1385
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,599
that we're actually providing enough

1386
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:55,119
calories so if we're providing enough

1387
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,880
calories and our body's like yep sweet

1388
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,760
we got enough for all the things that we

1389
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,880
need to do in a day overcome the stress

1390
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,000
and we have enough to uh fuel the

1391
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,520
training and the changes we want with

1392
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,039
the exercise we're doing you're going to

1393
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:09,599
get those abs wow and then the compound

1394
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,559
movements like working abs in a

1395
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:13,559
functional way not doing sit-ups but

1396
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:16,480
like doing deadlifts or squats where you

1397
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,039
have to use your abs as a support

1398
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:22,000
mechanism builds them faster than you

1399
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
see you know guys on the floor doing

1400
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,440
lots of sit-ups or rushing twist yeah

1401
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,079
they're going to get those strong ABS

1402
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:30,799
but for women it's better to do this

1403
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:33,240
compound for that torsion to be able to

1404
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,880
use that as support because then it

1405
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,720
allows us to stand upright and have

1406
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,720
better posture because our center of

1407
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,960
gravity is down in our hips men's center

1408
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,000
of gravity is up in their chest so if

1409
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,119
we're working to control our posture and

1410
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:47,680
develop the strength through our core

1411
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,079
and we're standing up taller our ABS

1412
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:54,319
show wow cuz I I would be a happy woman

1413
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:55,920
if I never had to do a crunch again and

1414
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,880
so if I'm actually lifting that could be

1415
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,200
true so let's talk about the specific

1416
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,520
things we should be doing okay what is

1417
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,039
the minimum amount of exercise that a

1418
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:09,680
woman needs to maintain her health and

1419
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,559
to be strong if we are looking from an

1420
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:16,039
age standpoint okay okay let's start

1421
00:57:16,039 --> 00:57:18,559
with our 20s in our 20s you can get away

1422
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:20,760
with a lot right what does that mean so

1423
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,480
that means that you could do bare

1424
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,480
minimum couple of days a week of mixed

1425
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,920
aerobic and strength training so you

1426
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,760
don't have to do that much okay so it

1427
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,640
could be a total body circuit set twice

1428
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,559
a week and that means like going to the

1429
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:35,319
gym and doing the machines you could do

1430
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:37,280
that or you could do an at home circuit

1431
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,039
where you can do what I say every every

1432
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,839
minute on the minute so you warm up with

1433
00:57:42,839 --> 00:57:44,880
stretches and Mobility for five or so

1434
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,640
minutes and then you have five minutes

1435
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,319
where one minute is jumping lunges the

1436
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:53,359
next minute might be some push-ups the

1437
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:57,160
third minute might be um some overhead

1438
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,920
thrust or you know you're pushing

1439
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,319
something overhead the fourth minute

1440
00:58:01,319 --> 00:58:03,440
might be some air squats and then the

1441
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,200
fifth minute is completely off where

1442
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,000
you're recovering you do that circuit

1443
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,640
two or three times that's all you need

1444
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,799
wow and you don't even need equipment no

1445
00:58:11,799 --> 00:58:13,319
that's your bare minimum right because

1446
00:58:13,319 --> 00:58:15,119
we're talking bare minimums and talk to

1447
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:16,640
me about cardio because we've all been

1448
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,799
so obsessed with cardio so is cardio a

1449
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:20,720
good thing is it a bad thing so cardio

1450
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:21,920
is interesting because it's about

1451
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,799
intensity so if we're talking about

1452
00:58:23,799 --> 00:58:26,559
going for a walk that's really good like

1453
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:29,039
you're walking with a friend perfect

1454
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:31,119
because that's going to allow you to

1455
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:32,799
have some metabolic change it's going to

1456
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:35,359
improve your blood glucose it's going to

1457
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:37,559
improve your body stress resilience and

1458
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:39,200
hey you get to hang out with a friend so

1459
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,400
that's great it's Community it's

1460
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,839
connection it's all the great things so

1461
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,640
that's one kind of cardio if we're

1462
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,559
looking at improving our blood pressure

1463
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:50,760
you can do some walking but what we find

1464
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:55,079
is true high-intensity work that's uh

1465
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:56,799
really directed with call it Sprint

1466
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,559
interval training where it's 30 seconds

1467
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:00,359
or less as hard as you can go and it

1468
00:59:00,359 --> 00:59:02,200
doesn't have to be running it could be

1469
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,760
kettle bell swings could be air squats

1470
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,480
jumping lunges could be running could be

1471
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,359
cycling anything that's going to make

1472
00:59:08,359 --> 00:59:10,359
you go as hard as you can for 30 seconds

1473
00:59:10,359 --> 00:59:13,039
or less and recover for two minutes you

1474
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:15,359
might do two or three of those and that

1475
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,160
is such a strong stress that it creates

1476
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,720
this whole Cascade of change that

1477
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,480
improves your entire cardiovascular

1478
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,280
system okay so let me make sure I'm

1479
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,760
tracking so one thing that you would

1480
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,720
tell us to do

1481
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:30,280
is to do Sprint training which sounds

1482
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,799
horrible but it actually as you broke it

1483
00:59:31,799 --> 00:59:34,160
down was like oh I could do that yeah 30

1484
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,039
seconds or less of something that's high

1485
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:37,359
intensity whether you're sprinting on a

1486
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:39,039
treadmill or you're doing kettle ball

1487
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:40,799
swings or you're doing push-ups or

1488
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:42,440
you're doing jumping jacks or just

1489
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:45,440
something right and then you rest for a

1490
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,920
minute and a half minute and a half to

1491
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,880
two minutes because we want a full

1492
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,880
recovery from it's more of a central

1493
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,640
nervous system recovery because we want

1494
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,359
to be able to go just as hard if not

1495
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:56,920
harder for the next interval and then

1496
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,319
how many of those am I doing so you

1497
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,760
don't want to do any more than five oh I

1498
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,720
love the minimum that's it yeah I can do

1499
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,240
that that's the maximum five is the

1500
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:08,319
maximum now we're talking Dr Sims some

1501
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,720
people will go I can do all five and

1502
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,319
then they start and if they're doing it

1503
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:13,880
properly after two they're like I can't

1504
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,960
do anymore that's fine you've gotten

1505
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,960
that impetus of stress and it creates

1506
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,799
this whole Cascade where all of a sudden

1507
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:22,680
your muscles are releasing signals

1508
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,799
called myocin that now is telling your

1509
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:27,119
liver let's not store that visceral fat

1510
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:29,799
we need the that fat for other things

1511
01:00:29,799 --> 01:00:31,440
it's also telling your body we don't

1512
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,200
want to store Under the Skin

1513
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,640
subcutaneous fat we need that fat for

1514
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,319
other things it's also telling your

1515
01:00:37,319 --> 01:00:38,760
muscles to open up and bring

1516
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,640
carbohydrate in so our insulin become or

1517
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,680
we become more sensitive to insulin so

1518
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,799
there's so many great things about that

1519
01:00:45,799 --> 01:00:48,359
high high intensity and by the way your

1520
01:00:48,359 --> 01:00:49,839
blood vessels are going to respond

1521
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:51,480
really well so you get better blood

1522
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,559
vessel compliance vasod dilation

1523
01:00:53,559 --> 01:00:55,359
constriction so better blood pressure

1524
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:58,400
control because again your body responds

1525
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,960
to stress and it's such a strong stress

1526
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,559
your body's like there's this whole

1527
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:04,920
Myriad of things that I need to be able

1528
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:08,839
to do to do that stress again so it's a

1529
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:11,480
really effective means of getting heart

1530
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:15,039
health better metabolic health and

1531
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:17,440
better body composition and burning fat

1532
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,880
in 30 seconds of effort yeah I mean I I

1533
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,119
am G to I actually going to do that good

1534
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:24,880
that sounds like something because when

1535
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,559
you were going the box I'm like I think

1536
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:29,160
I can absolutely do that and again I

1537
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,520
also love that it doesn't take a lot of

1538
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,799
time no I mean I come from a huge

1539
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:38,119
endurance background but now I'm tra

1540
01:01:38,119 --> 01:01:40,079
like I live in New Zealand I'm traveling

1541
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:41,720
the world I have a daughter I have a

1542
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:45,920
business super busy and I still want to

1543
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,720
exercise because one it helps with

1544
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,160
stress resilient two yeah I'm like you

1545
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,520
know there's a little Aesthetics and

1546
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,200
vanity in there of course and Sprint

1547
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:57,640
interval it's so between lifting three

1548
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,880
days a week and some Sprint training

1549
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,520
that's pretty much what I do because

1550
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,440
that's all I have time for lifting three

1551
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,559
days a week MH and that Sprint training

1552
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:09,480
we just heard of 30 second bursts full

1553
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,200
recovery for a minute and a half to two

1554
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,599
minutes and try to do it five times

1555
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,599
maximum yep and sometimes I put that on

1556
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,720
the end of my strength training because

1557
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,960
if I'm already at the gym I might finish

1558
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:22,119
with some aerodine bike you know 30

1559
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:24,079
seconds as hard as I can go so I'm

1560
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:26,400
maximizing time so I don't spend any

1561
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,400
more than 45 minutes to an hour in the

1562
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,839
gym so if you had to bottom line what a

1563
01:02:30,839 --> 01:02:33,599
woman should be doing in her 20s versus

1564
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:36,520
her 30s versus or 40s versus 50s and up

1565
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,760
what would it be so strength training

1566
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,480
across the board okay the type of

1567
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,520
strength training you do is different so

1568
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,960
when we're in our 20s and our early 30s

1569
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,880
we can do some of the protocol stuff

1570
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,720
that that is out there for men like

1571
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,559
you're doing your 10 to 12 reps or

1572
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:53,680
you're going to failure or you're going

1573
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,559
in you're doing a full body workout

1574
01:02:55,559 --> 01:02:57,640
you're going to get results as we start

1575
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,039
to get into our mid-30s and onward we

1576
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:02,520
start to have changes in our estrogen

1577
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,359
progesterone and it doesn't quite work

1578
01:03:04,359 --> 01:03:06,599
for us okay because now we need to find

1579
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:08,799
an external stress that's going to

1580
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,279
create the same responses that those

1581
01:03:11,279 --> 01:03:14,640
hormones used to support okay so now we

1582
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,720
want to look at more of a power-based

1583
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,079
type training what does that mean yeah

1584
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:23,200
like 30 up your hormones change and now

1585
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,200
the 10 to 12 reps that we've all been

1586
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,119
socialized

1587
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:28,880
does not work is why we all start

1588
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,920
bitching about the fact that our bodies

1589
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,960
are not responding to what we always

1590
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,960
used to do this makes a lot of sense Dr

1591
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,799
Sims so when you're doing the higher

1592
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:39,000
reps it's more of what we call metabolic

1593
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,760
stress so that's more like muscle

1594
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:43,279
contraction using fuel yeah but it's not

1595
01:03:43,279 --> 01:03:45,279
an impetus to build lean mass or to

1596
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:48,039
become stronger so this is where I say

1597
01:03:48,039 --> 01:03:49,400
the power base so when we're talking

1598
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,799
about the spectrum of weights and and

1599
01:03:51,799 --> 01:03:54,480
and the reps and sets and stuff power

1600
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,799
based is zero to six to eight reps oh I

1601
01:03:57,799 --> 01:04:00,559
love that I can do less yes but it has

1602
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:03,240
to be heavy okay has to be heavy but

1603
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,839
okay yeah so that means that you go and

1604
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:08,200
you pick up say we pick up this 20 right

1605
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,799
and you're like oh yeah I can do 10

1606
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:13,359
overhead no problem maybe I could do two

1607
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:15,319
more great so we call that 10 with two

1608
01:04:15,319 --> 01:04:17,559
reps in reserve okay we want you to be

1609
01:04:17,559 --> 01:04:19,480
at a six with two reps in reserve so

1610
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,039
that means I would have you put the 20

1611
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:23,799
down and pick up those 30s and see can

1612
01:04:23,799 --> 01:04:27,520
you do six really good wow not failing

1613
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,240
form and then could you eek out two more

1614
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,960
great that's the weight that we want you

1615
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:35,480
to use gotcha so I'm definitely lifting

1616
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,440
way too

1617
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:40,359
light and I am lifting far too much of

1618
01:04:40,359 --> 01:04:41,960
it like the little tiny two pound

1619
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,839
weights with the put those down put

1620
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:45,200
those down like those aren't doing

1621
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,400
anything for my chicken wing arms no no

1622
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,359
not at all okay not at all well that

1623
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:51,279
explains it because I'm like why does

1624
01:04:51,279 --> 01:04:52,960
this hurt so much and I'm getting zero

1625
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,279
result here yeah but my daughter's

1626
01:04:55,279 --> 01:04:58,400
literally look like they're cut yeah wow

1627
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,200
cuz they respond well to metabolic

1628
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,559
stress as our bodies get older we need

1629
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:06,000
more of a central nervous system Goa so

1630
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,319
the general takeaway here is that when

1631
01:05:09,319 --> 01:05:12,119
we hit that sort of late 30s to 40s Mark

1632
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:14,640
and our estrogen is dropping and our

1633
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,400
bodies are changing and we're not

1634
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,960
getting the same results you got to

1635
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:20,640
really focus on these Sprint trainings

1636
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,839
and also doing weight training where the

1637
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:26,039
load is heavier but the reps are are

1638
01:05:26,039 --> 01:05:29,599
shorter yeah but I don't want women who

1639
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:32,559
are listening to go oh I heard Mel's

1640
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:34,440
podcast and I have to go lift these

1641
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,279
heavy weights and do Sprint training it

1642
01:05:36,279 --> 01:05:38,920
takes time yeah to learn how to do

1643
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,240
things well without getting injured

1644
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,760
because I mean when we get older we're

1645
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,799
more susceptible to soft tissue injury

1646
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:47,680
joint injuries so I always want women to

1647
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,440
learn how to move first so if you've

1648
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,240
never done any kind of strength training

1649
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,400
don't be put off by oh I heard I have to

1650
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,920
lift heavy weights I better not do at

1651
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:59,079
all no any kind of resistance is good

1652
01:05:59,079 --> 01:06:01,279
maybe it's just body weight at the start

1653
01:06:01,279 --> 01:06:03,000
maybe you're doing a body weight circuit

1654
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,559
and then maybe you're putting a backpack

1655
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:06,279
with some stuff that's in there to make

1656
01:06:06,279 --> 01:06:08,319
it a little bit heavier maybe you're

1657
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:10,240
following somebody online that's

1658
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:13,079
teaching you how to move properly first

1659
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:14,839
and over the course of time you can add

1660
01:06:14,839 --> 01:06:16,640
load because your body is learning how

1661
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,079
to move and it's becoming stress

1662
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:21,599
resilient so you add load to increase

1663
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:24,440
that stress and then over the course of

1664
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,240
six to eight months you're going to be

1665
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,720
in lifting heavy weights and doing the

1666
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:31,640
Sprints without injury so it's not a

1667
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,200
training block like we've all been

1668
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,039
conditioned to what do I do every day in

1669
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:37,160
and out in and out so I can get X

1670
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,760
results we want to think about what am I

1671
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,319
doing to improve my overall health my

1672
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:45,400
strength my bones my brain so that when

1673
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,960
I'm 80 I'm self-sufficient when I'm 90

1674
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,000
I'm self-sufficient it's not a training

1675
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,279
Block it's a lifestyle that we want in

1676
01:06:52,279 --> 01:06:54,119
so it takes time to build into that

1677
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:56,799
lifestyle so I another question from a

1678
01:06:56,799 --> 01:06:59,960
listener named Aaron is it better to use

1679
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,799
machines or free

1680
01:07:01,799 --> 01:07:04,720
weights with machines I want people to

1681
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,920
realize that it's hard for a woman to

1682
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,359
actually get the machines to fit well

1683
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:13,760
because they are designed for a 58 to 6

1684
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:19,000
foot guy who's 160 to 190 lbs so if you

1685
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,279
are outside of that Norm it's really

1686
01:07:21,279 --> 01:07:23,000
hard to get the right fit which can

1687
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,319
predispose you to

1688
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:27,520
injury if if you are just getting

1689
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,799
started it can be a way because you're

1690
01:07:29,799 --> 01:07:31,839
not going to put a lot of load on you're

1691
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:35,000
not going to get as injured like I'm not

1692
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
for me personally I'm not a huge fan of

1693
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,799
something like Planet Fitness but I do

1694
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:40,319
appreciate the fact that they've opened

1695
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:42,440
the doors to so many people to make

1696
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:45,559
lifting accessible so a woman can go in

1697
01:07:45,559 --> 01:07:47,960
and use their machine circuit and get

1698
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,799
some resistance and some load to start

1699
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:52,760
to get them self resilient so then they

1700
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:55,079
can move away from those machines and

1701
01:07:55,079 --> 01:07:58,839
get into to dumbbells I like more of the

1702
01:07:58,839 --> 01:08:00,880
free weights where you have a barbell or

1703
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,839
a dumbbell because you have to use more

1704
01:08:02,839 --> 01:08:05,640
of your stabilizing muscles which is how

1705
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:07,599
we move anyway because you're not going

1706
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:09,480
to go pick up a bag of groceries just

1707
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,599
with your arm right so if you're looking

1708
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:14,680
at um bicep curls or tricep dips on a

1709
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:18,640
machine that's not functional per se yes

1710
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,319
you're adding load but I like it when

1711
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:22,279
people are okay I've got to lift the

1712
01:08:22,279 --> 01:08:24,000
groceries or I've got to lift this

1713
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,560
overhead so I'm going to do a full squat

1714
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,719
using my abs and I'm going to go from

1715
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:31,000
ground to overhead it could be with a

1716
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,120
plate could be with a dumbbell it could

1717
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,359
just be that motion at start because we

1718
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:38,080
have to think about how we move in the

1719
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:41,279
day I would love to have you talk

1720
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:43,600
directly to the person listening who has

1721
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:47,239
never stepped foot in a gym because I do

1722
01:08:47,239 --> 01:08:49,239
think you know even though I'm in shape

1723
01:08:49,239 --> 01:08:51,120
and I know a little bit about what I

1724
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,839
should be doing I always feel

1725
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:56,159
intimidated when I go to a gym

1726
01:08:56,159 --> 01:08:58,239
because there's always guys like it's

1727
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:00,080
filled with guys yep and there's more

1728
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,000
and more women which is great but if I

1729
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,759
walk into a gym even at a hotel and I'm

1730
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:07,480
seeing all the machines and then I see

1731
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,440
the free weight space and then I see the

1732
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:12,159
little space over and I don't know

1733
01:09:12,159 --> 01:09:14,839
exactly what I should be doing right I

1734
01:09:14,839 --> 01:09:17,000
don't stay long and I leave and I would

1735
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,600
love to have you since you've been in

1736
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:22,400
this industry for so long talk to the

1737
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,440
person who wants to do something and

1738
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,480
wants to learn about this but the idea

1739
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:30,839
of actually walking into the local gym

1740
01:09:30,839 --> 01:09:33,719
is just daunting yep so what do you want

1741
01:09:33,719 --> 01:09:35,080
them to know though about the people at

1742
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,120
the front desk

1743
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:40,080
and the way that people at a gym think

1744
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,440
about somebody new Walking In yeah so

1745
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:47,239
gyms are super gendered I sometimes get

1746
01:09:47,239 --> 01:09:50,359
intimidated you do yeah so I'll say like

1747
01:09:50,359 --> 01:09:53,040
if I go to a typical bro gym like a

1748
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:56,840
Gold's Gym mhm I'll walk in and I'll see

1749
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,480
the lifting platforms and there's some

1750
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:01,280
big dudes and I'm like uh maybe I'll

1751
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,760
come back I'll go do something else

1752
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:07,159
first so it's it's still there because

1753
01:10:07,159 --> 01:10:09,080
the gems are so gendered and it's a

1754
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,760
fault of that industry where you walk in

1755
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,080
as a woman the front desk person looks

1756
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,400
at you and goes oh okay how much weight

1757
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,600
do you want to lose here's the cardio

1758
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:22,239
machines here are our classes if a guy

1759
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:24,320
walks in they're like yo bro how much

1760
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,679
weight do you want to put on how much

1761
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,520
muscle the lifting platforms are back

1762
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,199
there and we have bumper plates and our

1763
01:10:30,199 --> 01:10:33,080
dumbbells go up to 80 lbs so you know

1764
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:37,520
it's all back there but it's so gendered

1765
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,320
even if you feel like I'm going to go to

1766
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,679
the free weights because you have to

1767
01:10:40,679 --> 01:10:42,360
walk through all the treadmills and the

1768
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:45,080
ellipticals and cardio and then you like

1769
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,719
the free weights are here and then the

1770
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:49,600
lifting platforms are at the back yes so

1771
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,800
it's not surprising that someone who's

1772
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,840
not ever been in a gym situation doesn't

1773
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,960
want to go into a gym situation

1774
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,400
and the way that we can get started in

1775
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,880
this is put the gem out out of your head

1776
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,800
at the moment right so we can look at

1777
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,320
there are two main things that allow

1778
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,960
women to thrive in strength training one

1779
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,600
is knowing what to do and two is

1780
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,840
community right we see that working out

1781
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:17,199
with someone else is fun for one thing

1782
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:19,280
and two it allows you to push yourself a

1783
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,760
little bit harder it's just

1784
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,600
intrinsically you want to keep up or you

1785
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,760
don't want to look like the weak link

1786
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,640
it's just a psych psychological things

1787
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,520
so Community working working out with

1788
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,640
someone is super important so if you're

1789
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,239
someone who's like I don't want to go to

1790
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:34,199
the gym I don't know what to do well we

1791
01:11:34,199 --> 01:11:35,600
can look at some of the online things

1792
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,280
that are out there so like if you're

1793
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:38,920
really super super basic and you want

1794
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,199
someone to work with maybe oneon-one or

1795
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:43,120
maybe a small group you could look to

1796
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,000
someone like Loretta hog who does

1797
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,800
Loretta loves lifting she's very like

1798
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,040
she trains her mom she trains other

1799
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,840
people who are just trying to really

1800
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,040
understand how to do stuff in their

1801
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,920
house it's a very basic way of starting

1802
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,760
and you can move forward from there if

1803
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,360
you're someone who's like I got that

1804
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,719
part but I want to work out with a

1805
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:02,480
friend and we want to set program then

1806
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:03,960
maybe you look at someone like the Betty

1807
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,360
rocker where she has specific programs

1808
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,960
where we can work out with her in her

1809
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,600
community or you and a friend can work

1810
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:14,080
out together and that's a way to do more

1811
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,239
stuff with dumbbells in the house then

1812
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:18,040
we can move forward and go to something

1813
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:20,080
like Haley happens Fitness that I've

1814
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:23,199
partnered with where it's from the gym

1815
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:24,600
where you actually have an app that

1816
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:27,040
shows you what to do you can go into the

1817
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,440
gym you know exactly what machines or or

1818
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,400
barbell or dumbbells to use you bring in

1819
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,000
a friend you can both do it together so

1820
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,719
you're like here's my app this is what I

1821
01:12:35,719 --> 01:12:38,120
do you can record everything keeps

1822
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,920
progress and you know exactly what to do

1823
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,480
and it's guided for 12 weeks and it's

1824
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:46,360
Progressive overload so you get benefit

1825
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,080
there's lots of conversations there's

1826
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,560
lots of community around it or you can

1827
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,040
even look if you're really confident and

1828
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,960
you're like yep I got that too I want to

1829
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,760
get straight to barbell with some

1830
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,239
dumbbell then you can look at something

1831
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,560
like Annie tourist daughters Empower

1832
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,840
which has a page from Crossfit so

1833
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,280
there's all sorts of levels that you can

1834
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:08,520
find and the big thing is grab a friend

1835
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:11,639
have a friend and have that ownership to

1836
01:13:11,639 --> 01:13:14,199
say for 20 minutes let's meet have our

1837
01:13:14,199 --> 01:13:16,920
conversation and do this together

1838
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:18,679
because we're going to get strong

1839
01:13:18,679 --> 01:13:22,199
together and it's fun I've been trying

1840
01:13:22,199 --> 01:13:24,760
to get my daughter engaged in some

1841
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:27,280
strength training stuff and she's 12 we

1842
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,040
have a project coming up where she needs

1843
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:32,920
to know how to move properly and I have

1844
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:35,159
her working with one of my friends in a

1845
01:13:35,159 --> 01:13:36,600
high performance gym but it's not

1846
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,280
lifting it's moving and having fun so

1847
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,080
she has another little friend in there

1848
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,880
who's a surfer and a soccer player just

1849
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,880
like she is and they go there and they

1850
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,239
have fun she came back first day fizzing

1851
01:13:47,239 --> 01:13:49,440
going I didn't know how fun it could be

1852
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,920
at the gym especially when you have a

1853
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:53,199
friend I'm like exactly it's the adult

1854
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:55,159
playground but little kids are being EXP

1855
01:13:55,159 --> 01:13:57,440
go to it it's like come into my

1856
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:00,120
playground a playground it is absolutely

1857
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,600
a playground where else can you like

1858
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,800
jump up and down on things and then like

1859
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,440
there's a rope and you can pull the Rope

1860
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:08,000
or there's a sled and you can push and

1861
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,280
pretend you're a bear or whatever it is

1862
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,120
it doesn't matter everyone's there

1863
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:14,600
sweating everyone's there doing stuff

1864
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,960
it's like make it time to play don't

1865
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,440
make it something that you're like I

1866
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,600
don't want to go this is too hard and I

1867
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:23,800
appreciate the list of resources and

1868
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,320
we'll make sure to link to those in the

1869
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:28,600
show notes so I have a bunch of burning

1870
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:32,560
questions that listeners submitted okay

1871
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,960
and we may have covered some of this but

1872
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:36,440
I'm just going to hit these so that I

1873
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,320
make sure to cover the things that keep

1874
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,760
people kept writing in about that they

1875
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,320
wanted you to answer Dr Sims okay can

1876
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,400
you talk about cold plunging sure should

1877
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,159
women be doing it what are the mistakes

1878
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:47,800
that we're making what's the difference

1879
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,280
between men and women and cold plunging

1880
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:53,840
so inherently women don't need as cold

1881
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:58,080
so thank you we don't no why when we're

1882
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,960
looking at stress response cuz that's

1883
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:02,639
how I view all the environmental and

1884
01:15:02,639 --> 01:15:04,159
exercise things is what kind of stress

1885
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:06,040
it puts on the body when a woman gets

1886
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:10,639
into ice cold or cold water and gets in

1887
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:13,880
there it invokes such a severe strong

1888
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:16,040
stress response much stronger than a

1889
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:20,000
male's response that her body goes into

1890
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,480
uh more of a shutdown phase where it

1891
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:27,000
invokes a sympathetic dve and it doesn't

1892
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,080
create the metabolic changes that we see

1893
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:31,080
with men if you were to take a woman and

1894
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:33,679
put her in 15 or 16° Celsius which is

1895
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:36,639
around that 55 degree Mark she'll end up

1896
01:15:36,639 --> 01:15:38,760
with the same responses that a man has

1897
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,520
because it's not a severe shock to a

1898
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:44,440
woman's body as it is for a man's why is

1899
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:48,480
that because we have more body fat so we

1900
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:51,400
tend to vasod dilate and Vaso constrict

1901
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:54,320
first for controlling our temperature We

1902
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,440
Men will Vaso constrict and sweat when

1903
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,719
they're cold no we're talking about just

1904
01:15:59,719 --> 01:16:01,480
in general okay so if we're taking a

1905
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:03,920
woman and putting her in ice the body's

1906
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,800
first response to environmental change

1907
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:09,000
is severe oaso constriction and with

1908
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,880
women with rain odds we have a stronger

1909
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:14,199
constriction response because it's a

1910
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:16,199
protective mechanism for men they'll

1911
01:16:16,199 --> 01:16:18,400
constrict and then start shivering to

1912
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,360
induce heat women will just constrict if

1913
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:25,000
we put ourselves into that 55 to 60

1914
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,239
degree water or 15 to 16° C will

1915
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:29,760
constrict and then start shivering so

1916
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,560
we'll get the same benefit it's just the

1917
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:34,360
ice is too cold for us to start that

1918
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,880
shivering so we need the Shivering for

1919
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,199
thermogenesis to get some of those

1920
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:41,520
responses so we don't need ice we need

1921
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,080
cool water I have been doing this all

1922
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,840
wrong and do you feel uncomfortable when

1923
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:50,120
you get in the ice well I I I mean I

1924
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,960
live in southern Vermont so there's

1925
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:54,199
always like an ice slick on the thing

1926
01:16:54,199 --> 01:16:56,159
and you're like having to take an Axe

1927
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:58,239
and you know cut up the top of the

1928
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,760
barrel or keep an agricultural bubbler

1929
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:02,239
in it to keep it from freezing it's it's

1930
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:04,400
got to be at least 32 degrees Yeah too

1931
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:07,120
cold and my husband gets in it and he's

1932
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:10,760
like a freaking like meditation Zen he

1933
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:13,000
just gets in sits down he starts

1934
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,400
shivering I climb in that sucker and I'm

1935
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:18,400
like and then I can barely breathe I

1936
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:21,880
never shiver right and the Shivering is

1937
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,440
what you're supposed to be doing in

1938
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:26,880
there yes because shivering is an

1939
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:29,600
automatic uh response for survival

1940
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,320
because when we're shivering we're

1941
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:33,600
increasing metabolic heat so we're able

1942
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,280
to keep our core temperature elevated so

1943
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,960
we don't die and it's a strong response

1944
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:40,239
that the body has to cold for women when

1945
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:41,840
we're Vaso constricting and we're trying

1946
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,760
to hold heat in we don't have the

1947
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:47,239
capacity because water on the cold skin

1948
01:17:47,239 --> 01:17:50,120
is pulling out the heat so fast that the

1949
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,960
body is just getting colder and colder

1950
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,440
and colder and we won't really start

1951
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:57,560
shivering when it's that cold so when

1952
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:59,159
we're looking at like if you get in the

1953
01:17:59,159 --> 01:18:01,600
ice it's way colder than if you get into

1954
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,440
a plunge pool that's cold so if we have

1955
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:07,560
4° plunge pool 4 de Celsius so that's

1956
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:10,880
about 38° Fahrenheit and you sit there

1957
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,639
in a little microclimate and you don't

1958
01:18:12,639 --> 01:18:14,840
move at all you'll create a warm bubble

1959
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,520
around you and then you might start to

1960
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,560
shiver so that's what we say if you fall

1961
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,600
through the ice and you're trying to

1962
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,520
swim it's like no just try to Bob there

1963
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:24,800
to keep this warm microclimate around

1964
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,679
around you so if you get in cool water

1965
01:18:26,679 --> 01:18:28,840
and you don't move then you might start

1966
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,560
shivering but for the most part that

1967
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,080
doesn't happen so for women let's look

1968
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,880
at a little bit warmer so we get the

1969
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,800
same kind of responses and adaptations

1970
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,960
that men have and if you do this in 55

1971
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:42,400
degree water so it's more cool it's not

1972
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:46,480
ice cold right what is the benefit to a

1973
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:47,520
woman's

1974
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,520
body by doing a cold plunge and how long

1975
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:53,440
should you be in it so when we look at a

1976
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:55,199
cold plunge the whole idea again is

1977
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:57,639
environmental stress so we start to see

1978
01:18:57,639 --> 01:19:00,960
an improvement in our um parasympathetic

1979
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,199
sympathetic drive so now we're able to

1980
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:06,320
get into that calming um because again

1981
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,239
body becoming resilient to stress we

1982
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:11,040
have an increase in our body's capacity

1983
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,679
for using glucose so we have better

1984
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:16,560
insulin um sensitivity better blood

1985
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,560
glucose control uh we have some signals

1986
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:23,000
to lose some of that deep body fat and

1987
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,320
we start to see better cardiovascular

1988
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:27,760
responses but women do better in the

1989
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,520
heat okay talk to me about this okay so

1990
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:33,000
when we look at sauna exposure women can

1991
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,120
tolerate heat a lot more than men so if

1992
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:39,600
we get into a sauna that is 80° or 60°

1993
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,360
Celsius so that's on the upwards

1994
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:45,080
of gosh metric math hold on I keep

1995
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,320
forgetting you live in New Zealand I'm

1996
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,600
like why are you talking Celsius I'm

1997
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,800
like okay that's why and science sence

1998
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:50,960
all that's true science science is

1999
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,920
Celsius um 130 degrees okay we'll go

2000
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,480
with that uh woman can sit in there sit

2001
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,520
up high 20 minutes or so not sweating

2002
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:01,560
yet right absorbing heat Vaso dilate

2003
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:04,360
it's great so we're heating ourselves

2004
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:06,880
our body's responding to it by uh what

2005
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:09,040
we call heat shock protein responses so

2006
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,320
these little proteins that will uncouple

2007
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:14,840
and then recouple and and be better for

2008
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:17,239
it so it's creating a whole cellular

2009
01:20:17,239 --> 01:20:20,120
change that then is like okay now we

2010
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:21,719
have better responses within the muscle

2011
01:20:21,719 --> 01:20:23,679
the muscle can use uh glucose a lot

2012
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:25,840
better it can use fat lot better we're

2013
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,440
also uh increasing blood flow to the

2014
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:31,000
brain we're also improving our blood

2015
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,239
vessels so they respond to hot and or to

2016
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:36,440
constriction dilation a lot faster which

2017
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,600
is important as we get older and start

2018
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,960
hit par menopause we start having blood

2019
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,520
pressure problems and it also allows us

2020
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,920
to hit higher temperatures on the

2021
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:49,679
outside um so like summer times and

2022
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:52,719
things without having an undue stress

2023
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:54,719
because women by the nature of being

2024
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:57,639
women struggle more in the heat so if we

2025
01:20:57,639 --> 01:20:59,159
environmental heat on the outside but

2026
01:20:59,159 --> 01:21:01,280
when you're in the sauna sitting there

2027
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,280
it takes time for the body to heat up

2028
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,000
because of our Thermo regulatory

2029
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
differences between what men do when

2030
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,320
they get in and they start sweating

2031
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,440
profusely and then they get dehydrated

2032
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:12,239
and they don't have time to adapt as

2033
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:15,000
well to the heat as women do because we

2034
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,120
baso dilate first and then we start

2035
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,320
sweating so if you have access to a

2036
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:23,360
sauna do you recommend that women sit in

2037
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,920
a sauna for the health benefit yeah I do

2038
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,400
how long like what what would you

2039
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,040
recommend like if you have access to

2040
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,560
this because I see a lot of the Bro

2041
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,239
scientists out there talking about the

2042
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:35,600
magical benefits of a sauna but now you

2043
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,960
I'm I'm starting to go okay for dudes

2044
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:40,440
but what about for me yeah and so what

2045
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:43,360
is the benefit or the protocol for women

2046
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,600
to get the maximum benefit for us so

2047
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,280
when we're looking at for health

2048
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,440
benefits and not performance benefits

2049
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,080
because there's two different things so

2050
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:53,400
for health benefits if we are doing 10

2051
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,520
to 15 minutes twice a week bare minimum

2052
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,679
you get health benefits and what are

2053
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:01,159
they so this is better cardiovascular

2054
01:22:01,159 --> 01:22:03,280
health so better blood um flow better

2055
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,320
blood pressure we have metabolic

2056
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,679
responses so we have better blood

2057
01:22:06,679 --> 01:22:08,760
glucose control better fatty acid

2058
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:10,400
metabolism so your body's like I'm going

2059
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,280
to use more fat as a fuel like meaning

2060
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:14,600
you're going to burn more fat if you sit

2061
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,800
in a sauna you will use the circulating

2062
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,719
fat as a fuel instead of storing it yeah

2063
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:22,520
this is my kind of exercise by the way

2064
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:25,560
that's great send this on and it

2065
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:27,600
improves your exercise tolerance because

2066
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,480
when you exercise you produce heat and

2067
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:31,280
one of the living factors for women who

2068
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,360
first start exercising is the

2069
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,560
uncomfortableness of being hot oh and

2070
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:38,840
then my my my face still turns like a

2071
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:42,320
tomato bright red yes I just am there is

2072
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:45,120
something about me that I I can lift one

2073
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,199
weight and it's like Bing yep and that's

2074
01:22:48,199 --> 01:22:50,159
that Vaso dilation first that's how

2075
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:52,719
women offload heat first and some women

2076
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:54,560
say I don't ever sweat it's like well

2077
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,320
because your body is offloading the heat

2078
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:58,880
so much through vasod dilation and

2079
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,520
you're not in a hot enough environment

2080
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,480
to absorb more heat so your body can

2081
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:05,360
Thermo regulate and be be fine even when

2082
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,600
you turn bright red and you hate it

2083
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,679
another question that a listener had is

2084
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:13,560
should you eat before or after a workout

2085
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:15,360
this depends on what you're doing so we

2086
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:16,560
know first thing in the morning we've

2087
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,280
already talked about it that you need to

2088
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:21,719
eat before you go if you are exercising

2089
01:23:21,719 --> 01:23:23,679
in the afternoon and you had lunch maybe

2090
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:25,159
2 hours before

2091
01:23:25,159 --> 01:23:26,520
then you don't necessarily have to eat

2092
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,239
right before but you do have to eat

2093
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:30,719
afterwards if you are doing what we call

2094
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:33,440
metabolically taxing so high-intensity

2095
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:36,520
exercise a cardiovascular session having

2096
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:39,000
a little snack before and then having

2097
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,840
real food afterwards is really

2098
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:43,120
beneficial if you're just doing strength

2099
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,360
training we see especially from the

2100
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:48,600
research of Abby Smith Ryan at UNCC you

2101
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:51,520
have around 15 grams of protein before

2102
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,840
any kind of strength training session it

2103
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:57,199
improves the post exercise Epoch or what

2104
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:59,480
we say your metabolism stays elevated

2105
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,520
after exercise for a longer period of

2106
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:04,159
time and it improves your body's

2107
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:06,520
responses to strength training so I

2108
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:08,679
guess the short answer is ideally yes

2109
01:24:08,679 --> 01:24:10,960
you'd have some protein before but if

2110
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,440
you're really pressed for time and it's

2111
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,239
in the afternoon and if you had a meal

2112
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:16,400
within 2 hours not

2113
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:19,760
necessarily um you in your work talk

2114
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:22,120
about supplements like creatine and

2115
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:24,679
caffeine MH could you talk about why

2116
01:24:24,679 --> 01:24:26,600
women in particular need to pay

2117
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:29,920
attention to these two creatine is

2118
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:31,719
something that's always thought of in

2119
01:24:31,719 --> 01:24:34,000
the bodybuilding set where you see big

2120
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,239
muscly guys and they're using creatine

2121
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:39,199
because it's a it's a metabolite or it's

2122
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,360
an essential thing in muscle contraction

2123
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,239
which allows our our muscles to contract

2124
01:24:43,239 --> 01:24:45,639
really quickly and then recover and

2125
01:24:45,639 --> 01:24:48,600
contract quickly but what we also see is

2126
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:50,800
it's beneficial for all the fast

2127
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,040
energetics in our body so we think about

2128
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,400
brain we think about gut heart all of

2129
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:57,159
the things that use energy quickly

2130
01:24:57,159 --> 01:25:00,360
because it has to creatine is involved

2131
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:02,760
women by the nature of being XX have

2132
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,800
about 80 70 to 80% of the stores that

2133
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,040
men do primarily because men have more

2134
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:11,440
muscle but also women tend to eat less

2135
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,679
so we don't have as much coming in and

2136
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:15,600
our liver only makes about 2 to three

2137
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:18,040
grams a day if we supplement with it

2138
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,880
then we see everything improves our

2139
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,960
brain health improves our gut health

2140
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:25,040
improves cardiovascular problems start

2141
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:26,679
to dissipate and we have better muscle

2142
01:25:26,679 --> 01:25:29,480
function so there's an incredible body

2143
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:31,239
of research that's being done for

2144
01:25:31,239 --> 01:25:33,199
creatine for health for women we see

2145
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:35,440
it's beneficial in pregnancy it's safe

2146
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,080
to take in pregnancy and it's really

2147
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,920
beneficial we see it's really important

2148
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:42,920
for mood and cognitive function in women

2149
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:45,520
who repair and postmenopausal and then

2150
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,639
for skeletal muscle health and bone

2151
01:25:47,639 --> 01:25:50,000
health we see that it's beneficial just

2152
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,199
a small dose so we're thinking 3 to 5

2153
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:55,119
gram so that's a half a teaspoon that

2154
01:25:55,119 --> 01:25:57,480
you might put in your water or something

2155
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:59,520
once a day doesn't have to worry about

2156
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:01,920
timing takes about 3 weeks for it to

2157
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:03,920
actually saturate the body so you know

2158
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:06,719
you want to kind of be patient and after

2159
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:08,800
that you're going like wow why have I

2160
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:12,080
not been taking this it's so important

2161
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:13,639
well now I'm like wow I need to be

2162
01:26:13,639 --> 01:26:15,320
taking this because it's so important

2163
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:19,119
here we go um what is your advice for

2164
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:21,239
women who are struggling to balance

2165
01:26:21,239 --> 01:26:24,880
nutrition M and a busy LIF

2166
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,239
Style part of it is being prepared I

2167
01:26:27,239 --> 01:26:29,639
know it's hard when we talk about that

2168
01:26:29,639 --> 01:26:31,000
consistency and

2169
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,800
preparation um but then part of it

2170
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:37,560
reality right so it's like okay I know

2171
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,000
from being on the road it's hard to eat

2172
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,719
how I want to eat and I go to a

2173
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:42,600
restaurant and there's a salad and

2174
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,159
there's lots of stuff in it and I'm

2175
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:45,560
going to be one of those people it's

2176
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:47,400
high maintenance I'm like I don't want

2177
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,560
dressing can you put some extra veggies

2178
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:51,800
in there great so I have to make it work

2179
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:55,239
for me if you are super busy and you're

2180
01:26:55,239 --> 01:26:56,520
like running out the door to get the

2181
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:57,800
kids to school and then going straight

2182
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,199
to work and you're coming home and

2183
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:00,639
you're starving and you got to make

2184
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:02,159
dinner and then you have to do all the

2185
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:04,520
things that we all have to do we have to

2186
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,480
be a little bit prepared so I'm not

2187
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,040
saying take all of Sunday and prepare

2188
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:10,280
the week's meals because that's just not

2189
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:12,199
appropriate if we do our protein coffee

2190
01:27:12,199 --> 01:27:14,320
or overnight oats and we know what we're

2191
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,159
going to have and then we might have

2192
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:18,360
snacks in our bag I have snacks in my

2193
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:21,360
car that don't perish like I have nuts I

2194
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,199
have a couple of protein bars I have

2195
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:25,360
some Tetra packs of almond milk I have

2196
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:27,920
single sachet of protein powder just

2197
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:30,199
things that I'm like shoot I forgot oh I

2198
01:27:30,199 --> 01:27:32,520
have it in the car or I have it in my

2199
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:35,199
bag and it's just something that's not

2200
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:37,880
ideal but it is things that my body

2201
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:40,480
needs to get through and I always make

2202
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:43,159
the Precedence to have as much fresh

2203
01:27:43,159 --> 01:27:45,440
fruit veg and whole grains at every meal

2204
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,239
that I have so that I'm taking care of

2205
01:27:47,239 --> 01:27:49,159
my gut microbiome because if we take

2206
01:27:49,159 --> 01:27:51,560
care of a gut microbiome then it feeds

2207
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:54,239
forward in so many positive ways for

2208
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:57,000
mood and health and Immunity and I think

2209
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,360
that's one of the things that's missing

2210
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:02,639
from looking at I come from New Zealand

2211
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:04,679
here and I go into a grocery store and

2212
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:06,639
I'm like whoa there are rows and rows

2213
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:09,000
and rows of of supposed food but nothing

2214
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,440
to eat because of all the ultr processed

2215
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,239
sugar stuff that's on there with all the

2216
01:28:13,239 --> 01:28:15,040
marketing so again we go back to the

2217
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,360
grandparent idea shop the perimeter get

2218
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,760
as many fresh fruits and veggies and

2219
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,159
then you know there are some canned

2220
01:28:21,159 --> 01:28:22,679
things that you can get and some frozen

2221
01:28:22,679 --> 01:28:25,560
things you can get but really think what

2222
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,520
am I eating that's going to protect my

2223
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:32,199
gut if the person that's listening takes

2224
01:28:32,199 --> 01:28:34,360
just one thing from this conversation

2225
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:35,639
which is going to be hard to do because

2226
01:28:35,639 --> 01:28:38,760
you taught us so much

2227
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:42,920
today what would the one thing that you

2228
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:45,760
want that person to walk away with and

2229
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:46,960
focus on to

2230
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:51,040
be it's hard to make change and I want

2231
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:53,760
women to feel ownership of their own

2232
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,159
body

2233
01:28:55,159 --> 01:28:57,280
and it starts with consistency and

2234
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,920
making time for yourself it doesn't have

2235
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,679
to be a lot of time it could be 10

2236
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:04,639
minutes first thing when you get up and

2237
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:06,480
you might do some Mobility you might do

2238
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:09,080
stretches you might do every minute on

2239
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:11,360
the minute of squats and push-ups for 5

2240
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:14,159
minutes but something that is you and

2241
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:17,639
you own it and it helps you become more

2242
01:29:17,639 --> 01:29:20,320
centered and you're consistent with that

2243
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,080
it doesn't mean you have to get up and

2244
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,360
make time to go to the gym it doesn't

2245
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:26,880
mean you have to take time out of family

2246
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,440
I mean if you go to the playground with

2247
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:30,679
your kids in the afternoon move around

2248
01:29:30,679 --> 01:29:32,639
have fun make the kid playground the

2249
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:34,880
adult playground right it's consistency

2250
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:37,080
and what are you doing 10 minutes a day

2251
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:39,320
just for yourself you know one of the

2252
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:41,639
things that I'm excited about is that

2253
01:29:41,639 --> 01:29:43,000
you know there will be millions and

2254
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,520
millions of people that listen to this

2255
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:48,199
yes and if every person that listens

2256
01:29:48,199 --> 01:29:50,400
shares this with one or two women in

2257
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:52,679
their life or young women in their

2258
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:55,880
life the number of lives that will

2259
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:58,040
change simply because of the things that

2260
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:01,239
you've just flipped on our head about

2261
01:30:01,239 --> 01:30:03,880
the way that we think about strength

2262
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:07,560
about why you need to exercise in terms

2263
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:10,080
of intentional stress and stress

2264
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:12,480
resilience protein coffee has just

2265
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,719
changed my life doctor I mean just

2266
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:17,199
everything I've I had it all

2267
01:30:17,199 --> 01:30:21,040
wrong and for a long time and because I

2268
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,000
didn't know right and because I've been

2269
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,480
listening to the advice by men for men

2270
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:27,880
yeah and I am so grateful that you're

2271
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:30,119
here and I'm grateful that you have

2272
01:30:30,119 --> 01:30:31,520
chosen to listen to this and that you're

2273
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:33,760
going to share this with women in your

2274
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,560
life because I think what you're asking

2275
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:38,199
us to do feels like it's accessible and

2276
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:40,920
it makes sense and I'm excited to try it

2277
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:44,040
all and I'm just wondering if there was

2278
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:48,000
a mantra that you would love every woman

2279
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,280
to turn to another woman after they hear

2280
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:53,280
this or turn to their daughter and say

2281
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:56,840
or some something that like truth that

2282
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:58,760
we need to be telling each other and

2283
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:01,080
reminding each other that we've all

2284
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:03,840
gotten wrong what do you want us to tell

2285
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,639
the women in our

2286
01:31:05,639 --> 01:31:08,000
life oh well I could joke around and say

2287
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,520
women are not small men because that's

2288
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:12,719
easy to say but in all reality my big

2289
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:15,000
focus and push is creating body

2290
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,760
positivity right and the body positivity

2291
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:20,440
is how we feel in ourselves and how we

2292
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:23,600
allow our friends to talk and to feel

2293
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,920
about themselves because we could have

2294
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:29,040
all the body positivity that we want and

2295
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,960
feel really fantastic but if we're

2296
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:33,080
surrounded by friends who don't have

2297
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:35,639
that same empowerment and same body

2298
01:31:35,639 --> 01:31:38,560
positivity it's heartbreaking so being

2299
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,560
able to share that and say you know what

2300
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:43,480
take up space I want to be empowered and

2301
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:45,600
I want you The Listener to be empowered

2302
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,239
to say I deserve that lifting platform

2303
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:50,400
in the back of the gym and I'm going to

2304
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,159
go there and if there's a bro there

2305
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:53,960
who's looking at me funny I'm just is

2306
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:56,199
going to take the barbell and say I own

2307
01:31:56,199 --> 01:31:58,840
this space because I want every woman to

2308
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:01,440
know that they have a right in every

2309
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:04,960
place in every gym every situation to be

2310
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:07,639
strong empowered and feel positive about

2311
01:32:07,639 --> 01:32:09,880
the space that they're in so if we can

2312
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:11,760
turn to each other and say it's about

2313
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,280
being empowered and having body

2314
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:16,639
positivity then that feeds forward to so

2315
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:18,320
many different things it's a good role

2316
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:20,960
model for our kids it allows us to have

2317
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:24,040
more connection with our workmates our

2318
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:27,600
Partners it improves empathy because as

2319
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:30,400
an expat I look and I travel so much and

2320
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:32,960
there is a huge lack of empathy

2321
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:35,880
everywhere I land here in the states and

2322
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:38,320
I feel it so if we can just share the

2323
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:41,119
positivity and empowerment despite

2324
01:32:41,119 --> 01:32:43,520
what's going on in the world then that

2325
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:46,800
just improves all the things that we

2326
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:49,880
have in our lives and if every person

2327
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:51,639
that hears this shares this with someone

2328
01:32:51,639 --> 01:32:54,639
else and everyone starts to move maybe

2329
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:57,400
10 minutes a day I just think about the

2330
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:59,960
positive effect it has on mental health

2331
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:02,679
and the rolling forward that will have

2332
01:33:02,679 --> 01:33:05,600
on so many different things well Dr

2333
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,440
Stacy Sims you just made a huge

2334
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:08,840
difference in my life you have

2335
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:10,639
completely shifted the Paradigm in terms

2336
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:14,040
of how I think about exercise and what

2337
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:17,199
it is and why it matters and you've also

2338
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:18,960
explained why so many of the things that

2339
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:21,960
I've been doing just don't work and why

2340
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:24,119
and now that it makes sense I feel more

2341
01:33:24,119 --> 01:33:26,760
motivated yay to do exactly what you're

2342
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:31,880

2343
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:34,360

2344
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:37,080
with my daughters yay about getting

2345
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:40,520
strong and becoming stress resilient and

2346
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:42,880
actually operating in a way where we're

2347
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:44,560
not acting

2348
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:47,920

2349
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:50,320

that gym and I am going to do something

2366
01:34:23,239 --> 01:34:25,880
uncomfortable because I deserve to feel

2367
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:28,119
good in my body and that means I need to

2368
01:34:28,119 --> 01:34:30,000
start prioritizing doing it and now what

2369
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,840
