292
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,310
Moving right along, all
those subcortical bits, we're

293
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,830
just going to talk about three
of the most important ones,

294
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,350
the thalamus, this
big guy right smack

295
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,290
in the middle of the brain,
very large structure,

296
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,690
the hippocampus,
and the amygdala.

297
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,670
OK, let's talk
about the thalamus.

298
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,680
Think about the thalamus
as a Grand Central

299
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,040
Station of the brain, OK,
with all of these connections

300
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,960
going to all those
parts of cortex

301
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,910
coming in and out of
the thalamus like that.

302
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,980
OK?

303
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,460
So one of the key things
about the thalamus

304
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,640
is that most of the
incoming sensory information

305
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,570
goes by way of the thalamus
en route to the cortex.

306
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,110
OK?

307
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,780
So if you start with
your ear, there's

308
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,700
sensory endings in
your ear that we'll

309
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,290
talk about later in the term.

310
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,380
And they send neurons into
this, the thalamus here,

311
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,935
this yellow thing, through
a bunch of different stages.

312
00:12:09,935 --> 00:12:11,310
They make a stop
in the thalamus.

313
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,440
And then they come up
here to this green patch,

314
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,480
which is auditory cortex.

315
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,620
OK?

316
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,520
Similarly,
somatosensory endings,

317
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,560
touch sensors in
your skin that enable

318
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,380
you to feel when
you're being touched

319
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,750
come in through the skin.

320
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,150
And they make a stop
in the thalamus.

321
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:34,140
And then they go up to
somatosensory cortex up there.

322
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,580
OK?

323
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:40,290
Similarly, visual signals
that come in from your eyes

324
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:45,510
make a stop in the thalamus and
then go up to visual cortex.

325
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,270
OK, what's the name of the
structure in the thalamus

326
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,478
that those axons
make a synapse in?

327
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,520
Coming up from the eyes,
you make a synapse here.

328
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,620
And you go up to visual cortex.

329
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,470
AUDIENCE: LGN.

330
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,720
NANCY KANWISHER: LGN, perfect.

331
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,470
What does it stand for?

332
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,740
AUDIENCE: Lateral
geniculate nucleus.

333
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,220
NANCY KANWISHER: Perfect.

334
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,450
OK, you should know that.

335
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,930
This is review from 900, 901.

336
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,580
OK, yes?

337
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,080
Sorry.

338
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:12,150
OK, which sensory modality does
not go through the thalamus

339
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,370
en route to cortex
between the sensory nerve

340
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,450
endings and the cortex?

341
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:17,950
Sorry?

342
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:18,730
AUDIENCE: Olfactory.

343
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,570
NANCY KANWISHER: Yes.

344
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,080
Yes.

345
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,122
You guys are on the ball.

346
00:13:21,122 --> 00:13:23,830
Yes, olfactory system is
the one sensory modality

347
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,090
that doesn't make a
stop in the cortex.

348
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,340
You can sort of see that here.

349
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,240
From the nose, it goes straight
up into olfactory cortex

350
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,280
right there.

351
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,670
All right, so that's
the standard view

352
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,890
of the thalamus is this
kind of like relay station

353
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,680
where all the external sensory
information comes in there,

354
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,810
makes a stop, and then
goes up to cortex.

355
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:44,710
OK?

356
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,400
That's my thalamus act.

357
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:46,900
Boom.

358
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,620
Like that, right?

359
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,520
OK.

360
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,790
But, increasingly,
there's evidence

361
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,280
that the thalamus is much
more than a relay station.

362
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,380
And why would you bother
with a relay anyway?

363
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,340
Kind of doesn't mean anything.

364
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,360
Kind of means like
we don't know what's

365
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,220
going on here because
you wouldn't just make

366
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,970
a synapse for no reason, right?

367
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,098
OK, and so the
first thing to note,

368
00:14:05,098 --> 00:14:06,640
is there are lots
of connections that

369
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,420
go back down the other way?

370
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,720
There are 10 times
as many connections

371
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,880
that go from primary
visual cortex

372
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,610
right here in me, right
here in this guy in red,

373
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,360
there are 10 times as many
that go backwards down

374
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,680
to the thalamus as go forwards.

375
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,210
That's mind blowing, right?

376
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,580
Information comes from the
eyes up into the brain.

377
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,493
What the hell are those things
doing going backwards, OK?

378
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:32,660
Well, they're doing all
kinds of interesting things.

379
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,118
So that's the first indication
that the thalamus isn't just

380
00:14:35,118 --> 00:14:39,080
relaying stuff in a
stupid, passive way.

381
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,630
And the second
whole line of work,

382
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,160
which many people
are working on,

383
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,040
but I think some of the most
awesome work on this topic

384
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,430
is done by our own Mike
Halassa in this department.

385
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,290
And he does these
incredible studies

386
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,200
that you can do in mice with
these spectacular methods

387
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,530
that we can't use in humans,
where he can really take apart

388
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:59,020
the circuit and
magnificent detail.

389
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,610
And he's showing
that the thalamus

390
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:04,180
is involved in all kinds
of high-level cognitive

391
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,920
computations in mice.

392
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,150
It's really stunning work.

393
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,820
When the mice have to switch
from doing one task to another,

394
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:14,170
the thalamus plays a key role in
gating the flow of information

395
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:18,040
from one cortical
region to another, OK?

396
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,650
All right, moving along,
the hippocampus, I you

397
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,820
guys all learned about this.

398
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,560
The number one gripe
in this department

399
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,690
as we learn about
H.M. in every course.

400
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,990
So that's going to happen here.

401
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,720
But it's going to
last about 20 seconds.

402
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,770
So here goes.

403
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,207
That's a normal slice
of the brain like this.

404
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:33,790
Here's the hippocampus
on either side.

405
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,660
It's like a whole curled up deal
right there and right there.

406
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,080
And here is H.M.'s brain,
the famous H.M., who

407
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,110
had surgery to remove his
hippocampus on both sides,

408
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,950
and completely lost his episodic
memory for anything that

409
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,730
happened after his surgery.

410
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,230
OK?

411
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,440
You all remember that, right?

412
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,570
If anybody hasn't heard
of H.M., send me an email.

413
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,580
And I'll give you some
background reading.

414
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,870
OK, so very loosely,
the hippocampus

415
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,910
involved both in this kind
of long-term episodic memory

416
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,200
that H.M. lost.

417
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,050
And it also plays a
key role in navigation,

418
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:12,230
which we'll talk about in
great detail in a few weeks.

419
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,200
And I just want to say
that some cases are

420
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,960
even more extreme than H.M.

421
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,490
So there's a case of
Lonni Sue Johnson.

422
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,340
And I am trying to
get you guys a video.

423
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,550
And I didn't get it in time.

424
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,175
But I'll show it to you later in
the term if you're interested.

425
00:16:25,175 --> 00:16:28,000
Lonni Sue Johnson
had a viral infection

426
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,600
that went up into her brain.

427
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,080
She was an extremely
accomplished person.

428
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,510
She did illustrations on
the cover of The New Yorker.

429
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,440
She was a pilot.

430
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,900
She had her own
farm in which she

431
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:42,430
raised lots of stuff, a
very smart, interesting,

432
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:46,360
multitalented woman, who
had this terrible tragedy

433
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,240
of getting viral
encephalitis at I

434
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,130
don't know what
age, but middle age.
