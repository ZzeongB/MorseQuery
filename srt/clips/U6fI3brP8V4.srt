188
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:51,150
OK so moving on to more 8.04 things. Back to
atoms. So let's look at specifics of that.

189
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:58,630
I'm not kidding, they really are related to
black holes. I get paid for this. So here's

190
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:03,720
a nice fact, so let's get to atomic spectra.
So to study atomic spectra, here's the experiment

191
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,670
I want to run. The experiment I want to run
starts out with some sort of power plant.

192
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:13,970
And out of the power plant come two wires.
And I'm going to run these wires across a

193
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:19,380
spark gap, you know, a piece of metal here,
a piece of metal here, and put them inside

194
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:25,230
a container, which has some gas. Like H2 or
neon or whatever you want. But some simple

195
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,130
gas inside here.

196
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:32,339
So we've got an electric potential established
across it. Again, we don't want so much potential

197
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:38,070
that it sparks, but we do want to excite the
H2. So we can even make it spark, it doesn't

198
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,730
really matter too much. The important thing
is that we're going to excite the hydrogen,

199
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:48,210
and in exciting the hydrogen the excited hydrogen
is going to send out light. And then I'm going

200
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:56,850
to take this light-- we take the light, and
I'm gonna shine this on a prism, something

201
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:05,930
I was taught to do by Newton. And-- metaphorically
speaking-- and look at the image of this light

202
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,610
having passed through the prism.

203
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:14,330
And what you find is you find a very distinct
set of patterns. You do not get a continuous

204
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:17,480
band. In fact what you get-- I'm going to
have a hard time drawing this so let me draw

205
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,740
down here. I'm now going to draw the intensity
of the light incident on the screen on this

206
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,600
piece of paper-- people really used to use
pieces of paper for this, which is kind of

207
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,300
awesome-- as a function of the wavelength,
and I'll measure it in angstroms.

208
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:39,690
And what you discover is-- here's around 1,000
angstroms-- you get a bunch of lines. Get

209
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,860
these spikes. And they start to spread out,
and then there aren't so many. And then at

210
00:16:43,860 --> 00:17:01,120
around 3,000, you get another set. And then
at around 10,000, you get another set.

211
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,819
This is around 10,000.

212
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:10,220
And here's the interesting thing about these.
So the discovery of these lines-- these are

213
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:19,020
named after a guy named Lyman, these are--
these are named after a guy named-- Ballmer.

214
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:29,400
Thank you. Steve Ballmer. And these are passion,
like passion fruit. So. Everyone needs a mnemonic,

215
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:36,679
OK. And so these people identified these lines
and explained various things about them.

216
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:39,900
But here's an interesting fact. If you replace
this nuclear power plant with a coal plant,

217
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,890
it makes no difference. If you replace this
prism by a different prism, it makes no difference

218
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:49,670
to where the lines are. If you change this
mechanism of exciting the hydrogen, it makes

219
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,910
no difference. As long as it's hydrogen--
as long as it's hydrogen in here you get the

220
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:56,190
same lines, mainly with different intensities
depending upon how exactly you do the experiment.

221
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:02,350
But you get the same position of the lines.
And that's a really striking thing.

222
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,790
Now if you use a different chemical, a different
gas in here, like neon, you get a very different

223
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,900
set of lines. And a very different effective
color now when you eyeball this thing. So

224
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:18,630
Ballmer, incidentally-- and I think this is
actually why he got blamed for that particular

225
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,929
series, although I don't know the history--
Ballmer noticed by being-- depending on which

226
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:28,500
biography you read-- very clever or very obsessed
that these guys, this particular set, could

227
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,250
be-- they're wavelengths. If you wrote their
wavelengths and labeled them by an integer

228
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:37,110
n, where n ran from 3 to any positive integer
above 3, could be written as 36. So this is

229
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:44,020
pure numerology. 36, 46 angstroms times the
function n squared over n squared minus 4,

230
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:48,679
where N is equal to 3, 4, dot dot dot-- an
integer.

231
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:51,270
And it turns out if you just plug in these
integers, you get a pretty good approximation

232
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:58,020
to this series of lines. This is a hallowed
tradition, a phenomenological fit to some

233
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,760
data. Where did it come from? It came from
his creative or obsessed mind. So this was

234
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:10,510
Ballmer. And this is specifically for hydrogen
gas, H2.

235
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:16,750
So Rydberg and Ritz, R and R, said, well actually
we can do one better. Now that they realized

236
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,720
that this is true, they looked at the whole
sequence. And they found a really neat little

237
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,750
expression, which is that 1 over the wavelength
is equal to a single constant parameter. Not

238
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:30,559
just for all these, but for all of them. One
single numerical coefficient times 1 over

239
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:36,460
m squared minus 1 over n squared-- n is an
integer greater than zero and greater in particular

240
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:41,450
than m. And if you plug in any value of n
and any value of m, for sufficiently reasonable--

241
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,770
I mean, if you put in 10 million integers
you're not going to see it because it's way

242
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:52,750
out there, but if you put in or-- rather,
in here-- if you put any value of n and m,

243
00:19:52,750 --> 00:20:03,390
you will get one of these lines. So again,
why? You know, as it's said, who ordered that.

244
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,030
So this is experimental result three that
we're going to have to deal with. When you

245
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,530
look at atoms and you look at the specter
of light coming off of them, their spectra

246
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:14,799
are discrete. But they're not just stupidly
discrete, they're discrete with real structure.

247
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:19,559
Something that begs for an explanation. This
is obviously more than numerology, because

248
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:25,179
it explains with one tunable coefficient a
tremendous number of spectral lines. And there's

249
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:29,760
a difference-- and crucially, these both work
specifically for hydrogen. For different atoms

250
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,450
you need a totally different formula.

251
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:44,740
But again, there's always some formula that
nails those spectral lines. Why? Questions?
