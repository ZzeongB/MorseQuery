188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,990
OK so moving on to more 8.04 things. Back to
atoms. So let's look at specifics of that.

189
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:13,470
I'm not kidding, they really are related to
black holes. I get paid for this. So here's

190
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:18,560
a nice fact, so let's get to atomic spectra.
So to study atomic spectra, here's the experiment

191
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,510
I want to run. The experiment I want to run
starts out with some sort of power plant.

192
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:28,810
And out of the power plant come two wires.
And I'm going to run these wires across a

193
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:34,220
spark gap, you know, a piece of metal here,
a piece of metal here, and put them inside

194
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:40,070
a container, which has some gas. Like H2 or
neon or whatever you want. But some simple

195
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,970
gas inside here.

196
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:47,179
So we've got an electric potential established
across it. Again, we don't want so much potential

197
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:52,910
that it sparks, but we do want to excite the
H2. So we can even make it spark, it doesn't

198
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,570
really matter too much. The important thing
is that we're going to excite the hydrogen,

199
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:03,050
and in exciting the hydrogen the excited hydrogen
is going to send out light. And then I'm going

200
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:11,690
to take this light-- we take the light, and
I'm gonna shine this on a prism, something

201
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:20,770
I was taught to do by Newton. And-- metaphorically
speaking-- and look at the image of this light

202
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,450
having passed through the prism.

203
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:29,170
And what you find is you find a very distinct
set of patterns. You do not get a continuous

204
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,320
band. In fact what you get-- I'm going to
have a hard time drawing this so let me draw

205
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,580
down here. I'm now going to draw the intensity
of the light incident on the screen on this

206
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,440
piece of paper-- people really used to use
pieces of paper for this, which is kind of

207
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,140
awesome-- as a function of the wavelength,
and I'll measure it in angstroms.

208
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:54,530
And what you discover is-- here's around 1,000
angstroms-- you get a bunch of lines. Get

209
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,700
these spikes. And they start to spread out,
and then there aren't so many. And then at

210
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:15,960
around 3,000, you get another set. And then
at around 10,000, you get another set.

211
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:21,659
This is around 10,000.

212
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:25,060
And here's the interesting thing about these.
So the discovery of these lines-- these are

213
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:33,860
named after a guy named Lyman, these are--
these are named after a guy named-- Ballmer.

214
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:44,240
Thank you. Steve Ballmer. And these are passion,
like passion fruit. So. Everyone needs a mnemonic,

215
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:51,519
OK. And so these people identified these lines
and explained various things about them.

216
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,740
But here's an interesting fact. If you replace
this nuclear power plant with a coal plant,

217
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,730
it makes no difference. If you replace this
prism by a different prism, it makes no difference

218
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:04,510
to where the lines are. If you change this
mechanism of exciting the hydrogen, it makes

219
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,750
no difference. As long as it's hydrogen--
as long as it's hydrogen in here you get the

220
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,030
same lines, mainly with different intensities
depending upon how exactly you do the experiment.

221
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:17,190
But you get the same position of the lines.
And that's a really striking thing.

222
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,630
Now if you use a different chemical, a different
gas in here, like neon, you get a very different

223
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,740
set of lines. And a very different effective
color now when you eyeball this thing. So

224
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:33,470
Ballmer, incidentally-- and I think this is
actually why he got blamed for that particular

225
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,769
series, although I don't know the history--
Ballmer noticed by being-- depending on which

226
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:43,340
biography you read-- very clever or very obsessed
that these guys, this particular set, could

227
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,090
be-- they're wavelengths. If you wrote their
wavelengths and labeled them by an integer

228
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,950
n, where n ran from 3 to any positive integer
above 3, could be written as 36. So this is

229
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:58,860
pure numerology. 36, 46 angstroms times the
function n squared over n squared minus 4,

230
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,519
where N is equal to 3, 4, dot dot dot-- an
integer.

231
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,110
And it turns out if you just plug in these
integers, you get a pretty good approximation

232
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:12,860
to this series of lines. This is a hallowed
tradition, a phenomenological fit to some

233
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,600
data. Where did it come from? It came from
his creative or obsessed mind. So this was

234
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:25,350
Ballmer. And this is specifically for hydrogen
gas, H2.

235
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:31,590
So Rydberg and Ritz, R and R, said, well actually
we can do one better. Now that they realized

236
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,560
that this is true, they looked at the whole
sequence. And they found a really neat little

237
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,590
expression, which is that 1 over the wavelength
is equal to a single constant parameter. Not

238
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:45,399
just for all these, but for all of them. One
single numerical coefficient times 1 over

239
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:51,300
m squared minus 1 over n squared-- n is an
integer greater than zero and greater in particular

240
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,290
than m. And if you plug in any value of n
and any value of m, for sufficiently reasonable--

241
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,610
I mean, if you put in 10 million integers
you're not going to see it because it's way

242
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:07,590
out there, but if you put in or-- rather,
in here-- if you put any value of n and m,

243
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:18,230
you will get one of these lines. So again,
why? You know, as it's said, who ordered that.

244
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,870
So this is experimental result three that
we're going to have to deal with. When you

245
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,370
look at atoms and you look at the specter
of light coming off of them, their spectra

246
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:29,639
are discrete. But they're not just stupidly
discrete, they're discrete with real structure.

247
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,399
Something that begs for an explanation. This
is obviously more than numerology, because

248
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:40,019
it explains with one tunable coefficient a
tremendous number of spectral lines. And there's

249
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:44,600
a difference-- and crucially, these both work
specifically for hydrogen. For different atoms

250
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,290
you need a totally different formula.

251
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:59,580
But again, there's always some formula that
nails those spectral lines. Why? Questions?
