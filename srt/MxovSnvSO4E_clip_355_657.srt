146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
immediately not even average it was bad

147
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,440
immediately on the glucose levels talk

148
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,400
to us about glucose spikes and why are

149
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,479
people measuring their glucose level

150
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,280
what does that show us and what are we

151
00:00:10,479 --> 00:00:15,599
trying to get our glucose to map so when

152
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,520
we eat a meal or food that contains a

153
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,680
lot of glucose so for example a

154
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,240
chocolate cake is a is a good option

155
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,599
good example or a plate of pasta or

156
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,560
anything else that starts you a sweet

157
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:27,720
when we deliver that glucose very

158
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,400
quickly to our body we experience what's

159
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,640
called a glucose Spike which means just

160
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,319
a rapid increase in how much glucose is

161
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,080
in your body and if you're wearing a

162
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:38,319
glucose monitor you will see this it

163
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,879
will look like this mountain that's just

164
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:41,560
rising and rising and rising and then it

165
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:43,160
crashes you don't need to wear at

166
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,640
glucose monitor to understand the

167
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,160
benefits of my work by the way but it's

168
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,560
a cool visual tool so what happens in

169
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,000
your body when we we Spike why is it bad

170
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,759
for us there are three main mechanisms

171
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,440
that are going on on a physiological

172
00:00:54,759 --> 00:01:00,319
level that make these spikes damaging

173
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,599
the first one has to do with our

174
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:04,400
mitochondria the mitochondria are the

175
00:01:02,599 --> 00:01:07,240
PowerHouse of the cell most people

176
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,080
remember that from biology class so your

177
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,199
mitochondria are these little factories

178
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,280
inside your cells that are responsible

179
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:17,120
for turning glucose molecules into

180
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,599
energy okay they're incredibly important

181
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,640
the problem is when you give them a

182
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:25,520
glucose Spike so when you deliver them a

183
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,280
bunch of glucose molecules very quickly

184
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,400
they break down they kind of go on

185
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,440
strike you know it's like when you have

186
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,640
so much to do on your to-do list that

187
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,479
you're just like I can't do anything I

188
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,240
have to go nap that's the feeling they

189
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,919
get they're like overwhelmed by all

190
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,159
these glucose molecules and they cannot

191
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:43,039
do their job properly anymore and so

192
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,960
what happens you feel this as fatigue so

193
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:47,560
you keep eating this sugar and these

194
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,319
carbs but you're exhausted you wake up

195
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,080
in the morning you're tired going to the

196
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,759
grocery store is exhausting playing with

197
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:56,080
your kids is draining your mitochondria

198
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,879
are not functioning properly anymore and

199
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,879
that's why one of the main symptoms of

200
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:02,800
having glucose spikes which most of us

201
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,560
have is this sense of chronic fatigue

202
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,439
now the second thing that happens in our

203
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,000
body when we Spike has to do with

204
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,080
cooking

205
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,720
so you know if you put something in the

206
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,840
oven like a chicken and it goes from

207
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,840
pink to Brown the chicken has cooked and

208
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:23,560
the Browning process is called glycation

209
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,039
the chicken has glycated it has cooked

210
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:30,039
now a human being from the moment we're

211
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:32,360
born we're slowly cooking we're slowly

212
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:34,560
glycating I know it sounds weird but

213
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,520
it's true for example if you look at the

214
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,919
cartilage of babies it's white but if

215
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,239
you look at the cartilage of somebody

216
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:44,840
who's 100 years old the cartilage is

217
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:47,319
brown we glycate we Brown as we age and

218
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,879
so much so that glycation is actually

219
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,160
pretty similar to aging and then when

220
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:56,239
we're fully glycated when we're fully

221
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,000
cooked when we're fully aged we die so

222
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,960
glycation is a process that we can't

223
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,600
stop We Can't Stop aging you know

224
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,160
there's billionaires trying to reverse

225
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,440
aging but so far they haven't been able

226
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,559
to but we can slow it down or speed it

227
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,960
up and glucose Spikes have something to

228
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:13,520
do with this right glucose and glycation

229
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,400
kind of sound like similar words it's

230
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:19,239
because it is the glucose that is doing

231
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,440
the glycating the Aging yep the cooking

232
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:24,720
the cooking so the more glucose spikes

233
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,600
you have the faster you age wow and this

234
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:32,040
shows on your skin wow you get more

235
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:34,400
wrinkles and your organs slowly age as

236
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:38,320
well so that's the second thing I had no

237
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,559
idea yep I did not know that yep wow mhm

238
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,600
mhm and the third thing that happens

239
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:44,760
when we have a glucose Spike well all of

240
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,200
these processes so the mitochondria and

241
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,080
the glycation they also increase

242
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,840
inflammation and inflammation is just a

243
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,160
nasty thing in the human body it causes

244
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,720
lots and lots of issues today three out

245
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,320
of five people are going to die of an

246
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,840
inflammation based disease so

247
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,920
inflammation is not good you want to

248
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,520
bring that down and the third thing that

249
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,679
happens when we have a glucose spike is

250
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:06,280
that your body knows that these spikes

251
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:08,440
are not good for you your body when it

252
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,119
senses this big glucose

253
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,679
it calls your pancreas and it's like hey

254
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:15,640
we need to get this glucose down so your

255
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:18,040
pancreas sends out a hormone called

256
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,960
insulin and insulin is amazing and she

257
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,679
grabs all the excess glucose molecules

258
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,520
and stashes them away into your liver

259
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:27,119
into your muscles and into your fat

260
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,600
cells and that's one of the ways that we

261
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:32,679
gain fat on our body but then too much

262
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,520
insulin over time that's the reason we

263
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:36,520
get type two diabetes so essentially you

264
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,720
have mitochondria fatigue glycation

265
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,200
inflammation diabetes IES and then a

266
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,920
whole bunch of other symptoms you might

267
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,640
feel depending on your personal health

268
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,880
history like brain fog like hormonal

269
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,960
issues that could lead to infertility

270
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,040
etc etc basically what I'm saying Jay is

271
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,160
that if you want a healthy body a

272
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,799
healthy mind you need to make sure

273
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,840
you're not on a glucose roller coaster

274
00:04:56,799 --> 00:05:01,200
because otherwise it's going to be very

275
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,600
difficult for your body to function and

276
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,239
for you to feel your best if you're

277
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,160
experiencing glucose spikes on a daily

278
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:11,520
basis what are some of the Hidden
