1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,440
the more glucose spikes you have the

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:09,120
faster you age wow and this shows on

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,719
your skin and your organs slowly age

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,799
today three out of five people are going

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,400
to die of an inflammation based disease

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,920
if you want a healthy body a healthy

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,760
mind you need to make sure you're not on

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,320
a glucose roller coaster your body

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,000
doesn't care whether sugar came from an

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,480
orange juice or whether sugar came from

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,840
a beetroot and is now in a can of

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,439
Coca-Cola those sugar molecules will

13
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,360
both lead to a glucose Spike

14
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:33,920
before we jump into this episode I'd

15
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,239

subscribing it means the world to me the

25
00:00:52,840 --> 00:01:01,399
number one Health and Wellness podcast J

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:04,159
shett J shett the one the only J shett

27
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:06,680
what is glucose and why is it important

28
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,840
to understand it I love this question so

29
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,640
glucose is also called blood sugar right

30
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,799
and glucose is your body's favorite

31
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,400
source of energy so make a fist right

32
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,000
now with your hand okay so as you're

33
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,439
doing this the muscles in your hand are

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,400
burning glucose to contract and for

35
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:24,040
everybody listening to us right now the

36
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,799
cells in your brain are currently

37
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,920
burning glucose to understand what we're

38
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,799
saying right every single part of your

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,280
body is burning glucose every nanc to

40
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,040
keep you alive and as human beings the

41
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,759
main way that we provide this very

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,640
important glucose to our body is by

43
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:47,439
eating Foods specifically by eating two

44
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:52,680
categories of foods starches so that's

45
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:57,200
bread pasta rice potatoes oats and

46
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,920
sugars anything that tastes sweet from

47
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,079
an apple to my favorite triple layered

48
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,719
chocolate cake okay so we eat starches

49
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:07,360
and sugars and we give glucose to our

50
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,599
body so you might think okay I want lots

51
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,400
of energy who doesn't want energy so if

52
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,879
glucose is my body's energy I should

53
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,080
give my body as much glucose as possible

54
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:18,599
I should eat as many starches and sugar

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,160
as as possible well that's actually not

56
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,800
the case I love to take the image of a

57
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,000
plant do you have any plants at Home

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,440
many okay so you know that in order to

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,519
keep a plant alive you need to give the

60
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,959
plant some water but what happens if you

61
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:33,360
give the plant too much water it dies

62
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,879
exactly and the human body is similar

63
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,840
some glucose everything's going great

64
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:41,519
too much glucose and problems start

65
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,000
happening most of us are giving our

66
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:48,599
bodies too much glucose and this leads

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,879
to whole bunch of symptoms cravings for

68
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:55,680
sweet Foods chronic fatigue brain fog

69
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,000
inflammation faster aging hormonal

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,480
issues and then longterm the development

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,720
of type 2 diabetes so so my whole

72
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,840
purpose is to teach people how to eat

73
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,560
the foods that they love the starches

74
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,080
and the sugars in a way that's not going

75
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,200
to cause problems so how do you keep

76
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,959
eating the spaghetti and the cookies and

77
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,799
the bread in a way that is not going to

78
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:23,080
damage your health that's the whole

79
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:25,200
thing and that's what I really

80
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,640
appreciate about your work and why I'm

81
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,599
excited about this conversation because

82
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,000
I think a lot of us think oh no I have

83
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,400
to cut things out completely or oh no

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,760
I'm going to have to completely shift

85
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,799
everything and actually you're saying

86
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,239
there's maybe that is the case actually

87
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,480
let's go there yeah let's talk about

88
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,120
that is there a need what is it that

89
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,680
needs to be fully cut out are there

90
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,159
things that we need to definitely avoid

91
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,239
in those two buckets that you just

92
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,079
shaped for us well we really don't need

93
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,680
sugar we don't need to eat sweet Foods

94
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,720
at all it's really just for pleasure

95
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,879
your body doesn't need that amount of

96
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,040
glucose that amount of sugar so when we

97
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,200
eat sweet stuff whether it's fruit or

98
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,239
chocolate cake we're doing it because it

99
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,959
releases dopamine in our brain dopamine

100
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:10,319
is the pleasure hormone so sugars we

101
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,879
could do without but listen I want a

102
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,840
chocolate cake for my birthday I don't

103
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,280
want to eat broccoli for my birthday you

104
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,400
know and it's all around us sugar is

105
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,880
delicious it brings us this pleasure so

106
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,560
of course if you could completely cut it

107
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,960
out it would be better for your health

108
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,600
but I don't think that's realistic for

109
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,919
most people I don't have that kind of

110
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,720
willpower and I haven't seen you must

111
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,520
know people who have completely cut out

112
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,080
sugar but it's quite difficult what

113
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,639
about you what's your sugar consumption

114
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,840
like so I'm an extremist which means I

115
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,479
either I'm eating no sugar so when I was

116
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,919
a monk I didn't eat sugar for three

117
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:45,280
years but then I can easily drop back

118
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:48,000
into eating sugar every day because my

119
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,520
mother raised me as someone who ate a

120
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,080
chocolate bar a chocolate biscuit a

121
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,880
chocolate yogurt and a chocolate ice

122
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,759
cream every day growing up chocolate

123
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,080
brother yes I When you mention that

124
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,280
chocolate Triple A Cake and you post I'm

125
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,840
like that is my dream and I have had to

126
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,759
through my wife's coaching through your

127
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,080
work had to develop a healthier

128
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:08,400
relationship with sugar because I

129
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,520
believe a few years ago I was genuinely

130
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,160
addicted to sugar and I want to talk to

131
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,479
you about that and for me it's taken a

132
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,440
lot of retraining a lot of steps in

133
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:20,440
between where now I'm back being the

134
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,520
extremist where I'm not eating uh

135
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,319
refined sugars at the moment but at the

136
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,199
same time I would allow myself on my

137
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:29,880
birthday or an occasion to allow myself

138
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,560
to enjoy and indulge I've just I was

139
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,960
wearing a glucose

140
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:38,160
monitor for about 3 to six months like

141
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,680
last year and I was shocked I was

142
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,479
absolutely surprised at the types of

143
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:49,120
things that spiked my glucose levels I

144
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:51,720
would eat a nonsugar cereal as a test

145
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,840
and that would take it to bad

146
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,800
immediately not even average it was bad

147
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,160
immediately on the glucose levels talk

148
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,120
to us about glucose spikes and why are

149
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,199
people measuring their glucose level

150
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,000
what does that show us and what are we

151
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:07,319
trying to get our glucose to map so when

152
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,240
we eat a meal or food that contains a

153
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,400
lot of glucose so for example a

154
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,960
chocolate cake is a is a good option

155
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,319
good example or a plate of pasta or

156
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,280
anything else that starts you a sweet

157
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:19,440
when we deliver that glucose very

158
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,120
quickly to our body we experience what's

159
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,360
called a glucose Spike which means just

160
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,039
a rapid increase in how much glucose is

161
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,800
in your body and if you're wearing a

162
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:30,039
glucose monitor you will see this it

163
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,599
will look like this mountain that's just

164
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:33,280
rising and rising and rising and then it

165
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,880
crashes you don't need to wear at

166
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,360
glucose monitor to understand the

167
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,880
benefits of my work by the way but it's

168
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:42,280
a cool visual tool so what happens in

169
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,720
your body when we we Spike why is it bad

170
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,479
for us there are three main mechanisms

171
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,160
that are going on on a physiological

172
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:52,039
level that make these spikes damaging

173
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,319
the first one has to do with our

174
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:56,120
mitochondria the mitochondria are the

175
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,960
PowerHouse of the cell most people

176
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,800
remember that from biology class so your

177
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,919
mitochondria are these little factories

178
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,000
inside your cells that are responsible

179
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:08,840
for turning glucose molecules into

180
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,319
energy okay they're incredibly important

181
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,360
the problem is when you give them a

182
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:17,240
glucose Spike so when you deliver them a

183
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,000
bunch of glucose molecules very quickly

184
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,120
they break down they kind of go on

185
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,160
strike you know it's like when you have

186
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,360
so much to do on your to-do list that

187
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,199
you're just like I can't do anything I

188
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,960
have to go nap that's the feeling they

189
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:29,639
get they're like overwhelmed by all

190
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,879
these glucose molecules and they cannot

191
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,759
do their job properly anymore and so

192
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:36,680
what happens you feel this as fatigue so

193
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:39,280
you keep eating this sugar and these

194
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,039
carbs but you're exhausted you wake up

195
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,800
in the morning you're tired going to the

196
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,479
grocery store is exhausting playing with

197
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,800
your kids is draining your mitochondria

198
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:49,599
are not functioning properly anymore and

199
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,599
that's why one of the main symptoms of

200
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,520
having glucose spikes which most of us

201
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,280
have is this sense of chronic fatigue

202
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,159
now the second thing that happens in our

203
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,720
body when we Spike has to do with

204
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:02,800
cooking

205
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,440
so you know if you put something in the

206
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,560
oven like a chicken and it goes from

207
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:11,560
pink to Brown the chicken has cooked and

208
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,280
the Browning process is called glycation

209
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,759
the chicken has glycated it has cooked

210
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,759
now a human being from the moment we're

211
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:24,080
born we're slowly cooking we're slowly

212
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,280
glycating I know it sounds weird but

213
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,240
it's true for example if you look at the

214
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,639
cartilage of babies it's white but if

215
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,959
you look at the cartilage of somebody

216
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:36,560
who's 100 years old the cartilage is

217
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:39,039
brown we glycate we Brown as we age and

218
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,599
so much so that glycation is actually

219
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,880
pretty similar to aging and then when

220
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,959
we're fully glycated when we're fully

221
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,720
cooked when we're fully aged we die so

222
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:51,680
glycation is a process that we can't

223
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,320
stop We Can't Stop aging you know

224
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,880
there's billionaires trying to reverse

225
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,160
aging but so far they haven't been able

226
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,279
to but we can slow it down or speed it

227
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,680
up and glucose Spikes have something to

228
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:05,240
do with this right glucose and glycation

229
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,120
kind of sound like similar words it's

230
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,959
because it is the glucose that is doing

231
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,160
the glycating the Aging yep the cooking

232
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,440
the cooking so the more glucose spikes

233
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:19,320
you have the faster you age wow and this

234
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:23,760
shows on your skin wow you get more

235
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:26,120
wrinkles and your organs slowly age as

236
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,040
well so that's the second thing I had no

237
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:32,279
idea yep I did not know that yep wow mhm

238
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,320
mhm and the third thing that happens

239
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:36,480
when we have a glucose Spike well all of

240
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,920
these processes so the mitochondria and

241
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,800
the glycation they also increase

242
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,560
inflammation and inflammation is just a

243
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,880
nasty thing in the human body it causes

244
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,440
lots and lots of issues today three out

245
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,040
of five people are going to die of an

246
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,560
inflammation based disease so

247
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,640
inflammation is not good you want to

248
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,240
bring that down and the third thing that

249
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,399
happens when we have a glucose spike is

250
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,000
that your body knows that these spikes

251
00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:00,160
are not good for you your body when it

252
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,839
senses this big glucose

253
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,399
it calls your pancreas and it's like hey

254
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,360
we need to get this glucose down so your

255
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,760
pancreas sends out a hormone called

256
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,680
insulin and insulin is amazing and she

257
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,399
grabs all the excess glucose molecules

258
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,240
and stashes them away into your liver

259
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,839
into your muscles and into your fat

260
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,320
cells and that's one of the ways that we

261
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:24,399
gain fat on our body but then too much

262
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,240
insulin over time that's the reason we

263
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,240
get type two diabetes so essentially you

264
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,440
have mitochondria fatigue glycation

265
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,920
inflammation diabetes IES and then a

266
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,640
whole bunch of other symptoms you might

267
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,360
feel depending on your personal health

268
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,600
history like brain fog like hormonal

269
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,680
issues that could lead to infertility

270
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,760
etc etc basically what I'm saying Jay is

271
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,880
that if you want a healthy body a

272
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,519
healthy mind you need to make sure

273
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,560
you're not on a glucose roller coaster

274
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,920
because otherwise it's going to be very

275
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,320
difficult for your body to function and

276
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,959
for you to feel your best if you're

277
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,880
experiencing glucose spikes on a daily

278
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:03,240
basis what are some of the Hidden

279
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:06,000
places glucose is that we may not see or

280
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,959
may not understand that we can't figure

281
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,079
out on a day-to-day basis because I feel

282
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:13,440
like when I went to that test of the no

283
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:15,480
sugar cereal in my head that didn't have

284
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,560
glucose only for me to understand it was

285
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,200
the rice that it was made from that was

286
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,519
having that impact on me so where is are

287
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,440
there any others that you know that are

288
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,880
hidden actually breakfast food is

289
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,200
usually a top offender right so orange

290
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,760
juice fruit smoothies breakfast cereal

291
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,760
even if they say no sugar or low in

292
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,240
sugar that doesn't mean they don't

293
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,920
contain glucose it just means they don't

294
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,120
contain any table sugar but they could

295
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,839
also contain sugar from fruit which is

296
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,880
quote unquote natural so it doesn't have

297
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:43,600
to be claimed as an added sugar in a

298
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,560
package right breakfast foods huge huge

299
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,200
huge offenders um and then kind of like

300
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,880
funny things that you wouldn't expect

301
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,040
like eating a lot of

302
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,560
grapes yeah if you eat 50 grapes that's

303
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,320
actually a lot of sugar because the

304
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,519
fruit that we eat today has been bred to

305
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,399
be extremely high in sugar and

306
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,200
concentrated in sugar but I think

307
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:06,560
breakfast foods are one of the biggest

308
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,160
ones oh also dried fruit people don't

309
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,120
realize that it's not because something

310
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,959
comes from fruit that it's good for you

311
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,680
dried fruit or fruit smoothie or fruit

312
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,760
juice can contain you know tens and tens

313
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,639
of grams of sugar even though it

314
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,120
originally came from a fruit but your

315
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:23,800
body doesn't care whether sugar came

316
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,880
from an orange juice and is now in an

317
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,320
orange juice or whether sugar came from

318
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,959
a beetroot and is now in a can of

319
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,040
Coca-Cola right those sugar m molecules

320
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:34,480
will both lead to a glucose Spike yeah

321
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,440
and it's interesting because I think the

322
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,720
way we've been trained to have a sweet

323
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,199
breakfast I've switched to savory

324
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,160
breakfast last year and that's something

325
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:46,360
you are a big big bigon yeah talk to us

326
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,800
about that switch well listen the

327
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,720
glucose Spike that we experience after

328
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,720
breakfast is going to control the rest

329
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,560
of our day so if you eat in the morning

330
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,720
something that is pure glucose like most

331
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,920
of us do right I grew up on orange juice

332
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,920
and Nutella crepes so I know sounds

333
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,720
amazing it was amazing but then at 10:30

334
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,120
I was exhausted because I was crashing

335
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,600
my glucose levels were crashing and I

336
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,680
was super super hungry because after a

337
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,199
big spike you experience a big crash and

338
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,320
that crash activates the craving Center

339
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:17,959
in your brain and literally tells you

340
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,760
Jay go find some chocolate you know and

341
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:22,360
you cannot resist what that voice sounds

342
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,000
like and you can't resist that urge so

343
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,600
your breakfast if you're having a big

344
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,279
glucose bike at breakfast you're setting

345
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,680
yourself up for a day of Cravings

346
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:32,120
fatigue inflammation and you're going to

347
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,399
feel quite awful an important switch to

348
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,120
make is to switch from a sweet breakfast

349
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,120
to a savory breakfast built around

350
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,639
protein right whatever kind of protein

351
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,600
you like maybe it's Dairy maybe it's

352
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,519
tofu maybe it's protein powder maybe

353
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,480
it's leftover fish from last night maybe

354
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,920
it's eggs whatever kind of protein you

355
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,040
want that's going to keep your glucose

356
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,399
levels nice and steady add some healthy

357
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,959
fats in there and you can have some

358
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,680
starch like a slice of bread for Taste

359
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,320
but importantly a Savory breakfast

360
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:02,600
contains nothing sweet it except if you

361
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,240
want some for Taste some whole fruit

362
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,040
right and you know all those sweet

363
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,199
breakfast foods that you love you don't

364
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,600
have to say goodbye to them completely

365
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:13,600
the best time to have them is for

366
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,639
dessert after lunch or after dinner

367
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,279
because if you eat something that

368
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:20,320
contains a lot of glucose something

369
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,800
starchy or sweet after a meal the

370
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,480
glucose molecules are not going to

371
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,839
arrive as quickly into your bloodstream

372
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,120
because that's already going to be food

373
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:33,000
in your stomach the worst time to eat

374
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,399
starches and sugars is breakfast because

375
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,199
your body is super empty so anything you

376
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,959
eat goes to your bloodstream in a second

377
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:42,360
right but it's actually the meal of the

378
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:44,480
day where most of us eat just starches

379
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,160
and sugars yeah think about the typical

380
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,759
breakfast orange juice oats with honey

381
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,199
on them breakfast cereal you know fruit

382
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:54,480
smoothies oatmeal with raisins exactly

383
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:56,800
and then you wonder why most of us feel

384
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,079
so terrible throughout the day why it's

385
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,639
400 p.m. and we're exhausted and we need

386
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:03,199
coffee or Red Bull we have cravings all

387
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:05,360
throughout the day and even at night

388
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,759
your breakfast controls how you feel for

389
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,320
the whole day and I think switching from

390
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,399
a sweet breakfast to a savory breakfast

391
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,160
is almost like you know in the movies

392
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,279
when they go through the mirror it's a

393
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,120
parallel universe yeah and you really

394
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:20,639
feel so different absolutely so so so

395
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,399
different all of a sudden you have

396
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,839
steady energy your brain is clear you

397
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:26,399
feel good you feel like yourself you're

398
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,079
not controlled you're not a victim to

399
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,519
these Cravings anymore yeah I found

400
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:32,279
though that as someone who has had

401
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:35,519
cravings for a long time or lived in

402
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:37,720
that sweet cycle there's been a lot of

403
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,720
withdrawal symptoms I think when people

404
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,600
stop eating sugar I've definitely

405
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,120
experienced headaches I think some

406
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,399
people experience very low energy

407
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,399
someone was telling me earlier today

408
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:50,120
that they feel nauseous or or sick like

409
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,480
there's a lot of different things that

410
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,000
come with it talk to us about why it's

411
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,959
so addictive yeah obviously beyond the

412
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,920
fact that we love the taste of it why is

413
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,720
it so addictive and how does it cause

414
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,519
those symptoms I think what you're

415
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,240
talking about is if somebody goes cold

416
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,360
turkey and just completely Cuts things

417
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,399
out and that's not actually something

418
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,480
that I recommend I think that again like

419
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:12,959
I don't have that kind of willpower um

420
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,240
and I want to help people improve their

421
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,600
health without having to give up the

422
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,360
sugar so even if you delay the sugar

423
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,360
from breakfast to after lunch as dessert

424
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,560
you're not going to get all those

425
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,079
withdrawal symptoms you're still going

426
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,720
to be able to enjoy it and get the

427
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:27,079
dopamine but with less impact in your

428
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,680
glucose levels and listen sugar is

429
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:32,600
addictive right and that

430
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,519
dopamine is very very very very

431
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,560
addictive and as human beings eating

432
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:38,560
something sweet is a very easy way to

433
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,120
get a hit now what you're talking about

434
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,440
can also be due to if somebody

435
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,319
completely cuts out carbs so starches

436
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,720
and sugars completely let's say from

437
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:48,199
today to tomorrow you cut out all carbs

438
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,759
that can cause issues because if you've

439
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:53,000
been eating carbs your whole life your

440
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,600
body expects these carbs every two to

441
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,319
three to four hours and your body is

442
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,360
actually just burning glucose for energy

443
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:03,040
so all of a sudden you cut off its

444
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,480
supply of glucose and it becomes a

445
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,120
little bit stressed out especially if

446
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,679
your body's not used to also burning fat

447
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,480
for fuel in a healthy body you can

448
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,360
switch from burning glucose for energy

449
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,720
to burning fat for energy easily so

450
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,199
either you eat glucose and your body

451
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,319
gets energy that way or you're not

452
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:21,880
eating and your body's burning fat in

453
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,919
most of us we're eating every two to

454
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,079
three to four hours some carbs and so

455
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,959
our body doesn't know how to burn fat

456
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,919
for fuel anymore it doesn't have that

457
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:33,840
muscle so so the idea is to train it

458
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:36,039
slowly to be able to do that not to just

459
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,520
cut out completely the glucose you know

460
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:39,039
cut the grass from under the foot too

461
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,960
quickly that's going to be difficult

462
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,360
yeah and I think that's one of the

463
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,360
biggest challenges right because when it

464
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,200
comes to New Year resolutions or when it

465
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:49,559
comes to changing habits we often think

466
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:51,960
we have to go in or out I hate that and

467
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:54,400
diets you know they don't work they're

468
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,440
super stressful they're actually a

469
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,240
pretty strong way to control women like

470
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,280
I have been from from the moment I was a

471
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,840
teenager the magazines are telling you

472
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,240
lose five pounds in a day you know lose

473
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,280
your belly before summer you're

474
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,919
bombarded by these messages that make

475
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,000
you feel inadequate if you're not on a

476
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,720
diet I mean it's pretty messed up the

477
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,760
amount of fat on your body or how much

478
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,320
you weigh is not a good representation

479
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,760
of the internal health of your body

480
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,600
right absolutely and if you're just

481
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,240
focusing on I want to lose weight I want

482
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,840
to lose weight there are very unhealthy

483
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,039
ways to do that that might actually make

484
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:28,400
your health way worse what I like to

485
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:30,960
teach people is these simple hacks so

486
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,960
save breakfast is very important one

487
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,960
eating sugar as dessert instead of on an

488
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,159
empty stomach is another key one and

489
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,440
these hacks are going to help your body

490
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:41,679
on the long term and create Better

491
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,360
Health from within and you might lose

492
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,679
weight for example in my experiment

493
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,720
about half the people lost some fat on

494
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,080
their body without trying to without

495
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,679
counting calories without cutting out

496
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,039
Foods just because naturally that's

497
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:54,480
where their body wanted to be and it

498
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:56,840
readjusted right but the objective is

499
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,400
not weight loss the objective is being

500
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,720
craving free and not feeling victim to

501
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,320
finding sugar three times a day or not

502
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,520
victim to the pot of ice cream at the

503
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,840
back of your freezer after dinner good

504
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,080
energy so you can actually live the life

505
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,080
you want to live and go after your

506
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,600
dreams you know that's the point and

507
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,000
play with your kids and have time for

508
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,000
yourself and then improving any medical

509
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,440
condition you might have from mental

510
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
health to infertility to diabetes weight

511
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,520
loss consequence but it's not the whole

512
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,480
point it's not a diet you know yeah and

513
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,480
it's a different shift in mindset really

514
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,240
because you're saying that a lot of us

515
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,559
are addicted to weight loss weight gain

516
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,320
or or something like that and you're

517
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,120
actually saying well let's make it about

518
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,760
energy let's make it about Focus let's

519
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:38,640
make it about make health health yeah

520
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,600
yeah which is which is which we just

521
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,159
haven't been trained to think that way

522
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,200
you know we haven't even I grew up

523
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:46,200
always feeling like oh if I didn't put

524
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,600
on weight then I must be healthy and

525
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,559
that's such a I mean it's such a

526
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,360
rudimentary belief around what health

527
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,720
and well-being is absolutely and it's

528
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,760
shifting you know we're now

529
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,039
understanding that's not the way to go

530
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,679
we need to focus on health not body size

531
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:03,320
or absolutely body weight absolutely

532
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:05,559
what should someone eat at 300 p.m. when

533
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,360
they're tired because everyone has that

534
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:11,720
post lunch you know

535
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,600
slump slump they they do but it actually

536
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,200
can go away if you study your glucose

537
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,640
levels and if you no longer have these

538
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,240
spikes you don't have to feel that

539
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,240
postmeal slump anymore because generally

540
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,799
that slump comes from your glucose

541
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,919
having spiked and now dropping because

542
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,280
after every Spike there's a drop and

543
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:31,440
this drop can make you feel really

544
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,799
really really tired so if you feel those

545
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,400
symptoms of the postmeal crash the best

546
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,880
thing to do is to start with your

547
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,679
breakfast so have a savory breakfast

548
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,799
then the second thing I would recommend

549
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:47,120
is at that at lunchtime make sure that

550
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:49,000
you start your meals with a specific

551
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,799
type of ingredient that is going to help

552
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,720
balance your glucose levels and before I

553
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:56,760
tell you what that is I want to tell you

554
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:01,000
about this amazing research study Jay so

555
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:04,520
researchers looked at a meal and they

556
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,120
found that if participants ate the

557
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:10,400
elements of that meal in a specific

558
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:14,080
order they could reduce the glucose

559
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:17,600
Spike of the meal by up to

560
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:20,080
75% huge that's huge without changing

561
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,720
how much they're eating without changing

562
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,919
what they're eating overall just by

563
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,679
changing the order and when I was in

564
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,159
school I remember uh biology teachers

565
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,240
telling us oh when you eat it all

566
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:31,440
becomes a big soup in your stomach

567
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,360
and so I thought how is this possible

568
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,039
how can the order in which you eat the

569
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:39,320
elements of meal have an impact so the

570
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:41,919
research is fantastic it turns out that

571
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,840
when you start your meals with

572
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,279
vegetables the fiber in the veggies when

573
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,760
you eat it first has time to coat your

574
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:52,400
upper intestine and create a sort of

575
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,799
protective mesh okay like a shield on

576
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,640
the walls of your intestine and that

577
00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:01,520
Shield then slows down how quickly the

578
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,919
the rest of the meal is going to access

579
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,840
your bloodstream how quickly the

580
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,159
molecules from the rest of the meal are

581
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,360
going to make their way into your

582
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:12,960
bloodstream and so veggies first is this

583
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,120
very important hack now the scientist

584
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,279
always my veggies L really because you

585
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,279
hated them yeah because you're right you

586
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:20,520
eat all the Cobbs First and all the rest

587
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:21,960
of it like oh yeah and you know actually

588
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,159
so when you go to restaurants they often

589
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,120
give you bread at the beginning of the

590
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:26,400
meal yeah and actually it's pretty smart

591
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,760
so I think there's a whole conspiracy

592
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,559
here because if you give people some

593
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,200
bread at the beginning of your meal so

594
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,080
you're super hungry you eat the bread

595
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,679
bread is starch it turns to glucose so

596
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,360
very quickly you experience this glucose

597
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,559
Spike and about 90 minutes later you're

598
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,039
crashing and that's when the waiter

599
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,000
comes over and is like hi anybody would

600
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:45,760
like some dessert and at that point

601
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,679
you're feeling this intense craving for

602
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,039
sugar because of that glucose drop so

603
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,039
you're going to order dessert wow that

604
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:54,600
that makes sense to me I love bread at

605
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:56,360
the St and end but the best thing to do

606
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,840
actually is to delay that bread and

607
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,240
first have your veggies and then have

608
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,039
your main dish and have the bread you

609
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,320
know during the main dish or after the

610
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,679
main dish and that way you can still

611
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,120
enjoy the bread but the glucose

612
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:07,880
molecules are going to be protected by

613
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,880
that fiber mesh and not going to create

614
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,520
that big of a spike so you won't feel

615
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,760
those Cravings 90 minutes later you

616
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,679
won't feel the energy crash so that's

617
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,320
another super important hack and if you

618
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,760
do nothing else just at your next meal

619
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,919
eat what you would normally eat just add

620
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,480
a plate of vegetables to the beginning

621
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,760
of your meal and it can be three baby

622
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,880
carrots it can be some beautiful roed

623
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,559
cauliflower with tahini or whatever it

624
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,799
can be some salad it can be any sort of

625
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:37,480
veggies you have in your fridge and

626
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,799
tomatoes count as well and you'll see

627
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,480
how different you feel after the meal no

628
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:43,480
crash no cravings and you know you're

629
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,559
also helping your body become healthier

630
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:49,880
from within and interestingly Jay this

631
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,880
hack actually has a lot of parallels in

632
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,360
cultural habits so you know I'm French

633
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,480
and in France we have this tradition of

634
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,440
crud at the beginning of a meal which is

635
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,960
raw veggies MH in Italy they have

636
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,760
antipasti which is generally vegetables

637
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,600
at the beginning of the meal in the

638
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:10,640
Middle East you usually start your meals

639
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:12,720
with herbs eaten by the bunch MH so none

640
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,840
of the stuff I'm talking about is that

641
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,720
revolutionary it's kind of common sense

642
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,200
but we've lost touch with these

643
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,799
traditions and now we understand the

644
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,159
science behind them so I want us to

645
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:23,200
bring them back yeah that's spectacular

646
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,840
there was a study you were about to

647
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,240
quote and then I cut you off tell me

648
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,640
with my I don't know you were about to

649
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,760
say and the study says and then I said I

650
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,640
used to eat my vegetables L I don't know

651
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,720
what that was I think I was just talking

652
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,520
about the food order so 75% and so

653
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,840
ideally from a scientific standpoint you

654
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,640
would always start your meals with the

655
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,919
veggies then the proteins and the fats

656
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,360
and then the carbs last the starches and

657
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,960
sugars last now you know that's a

658
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,760
scientific theory and if you want to

659
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,559
decompose your meal and do that specific

660
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,279
order you can but I think from this

661
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,120
science we can just extract the most

662
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:58,880
important piece of information which is

663
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,360
veggies first and the carbs towards the

664
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,480
end of the meal to reduce the spike I

665
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,600
think that's so practical I think all of

666
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,720
us can at least do that with whatever's

667
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,720
on our plates and if we can just make

668
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,159
that shift today we're going to start to

669
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,200
see the benefit and that will hopefully

670
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:16,480
push us in that direction exactly and

671
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,919
then naturally you crave less sugar and

672
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,320
you feel better and it's these small

673
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,000
tweaks and you don't have to cut out

674
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,240
Foods we're not talking about

675
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,600
restricting how much you're eating I'm

676
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,559
actually telling you to add food to your

677
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,000
meal and that is going to improve your

678
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,919
health so veggies first that's another

679
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,520
very key hack that I recommend people

680
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:37,760
try out how off is the recommended daily

681
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:40,000
amount of grams of sugar on any given

682
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,600
packages right so if you look at any

683
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,039
processed food or any packaged food it

684
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,799
will say this is 30% of your daily

685
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:50,399
amount how wrong is the daily amount

686
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:53,960
well so the American Heart Association

687
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:56,240
recommends no more than 25 gram of added

688
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,360
sugar I think for women and 50 grams for

689
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,679
men something like that but we don't

690
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,760
need any of this sugar we don't need to

691
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:05,919
eat any sweet stuff at all your body

692
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:08,399
does not need sugar to live so that is

693
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,840
an upper limit if you will yeah that's

694
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:13,039
an upper limit we're seeing it as the

695
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,120
basic requirement it's like saying uh I

696
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,200
don't know three cigarettes are allowed

697
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,200
a day it's like it doesn't mean you

698
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,120
should smoke cigarettes it means like

699
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,480
that's the upper limit after which real

700
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,919
problems start happening but it's better

701
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,760
to have

702
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:28,320
zero but then what these recommendations

703
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,039
don't take into account is when are you

704
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,679
eating the sugar is it first thing in

705
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:33,640
the morning so you're increasing

706
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,440
inflammation brain fog increasing risk

707
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,720
of diabetes hurting your mitochondria

708
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,039
having cravings aging faster or is it

709
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,840
after a lunch that had fiber at the

710
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,760
beginning of a meal where the impact is

711
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:48,559
going to be way less hardcore in your

712
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,679
health so if you if you just keep eating

713
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:51,320
the same amount of sugar as you're

714
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,279
eating but you just change when you're

715
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,760
eating it that's the first step you're

716
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,960
already going to see a big impact on

717
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:59,039
your health MH and then Second Step

718
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,679
could be reducing amounts for sure and

719
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,120
naturally because you're not creating

720
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:04,000
that cycle of

721
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,399
addiction you're going to have fewer

722
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,880
cravings for the sugar anyway there's

723
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:10,480
this other really cool study I want to

724
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,840
tell you about so scientists put

725
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,640
participants in an fmri scanner you know

726
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,320
those big donut scanners okay so they

727
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,320
were looking at their brain activity and

728
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,840
as the participants were in the scanner

729
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:24,039
there was a screen in front of their

730
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:27,799
eyes and the screen showed images of

731
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:30,679
food chocolate cake Donuts broccoli

732
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:32,799
Burger Etc and the scientist asked the

733
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:34,919
participants to rate how much they

734
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,600
wanted to eat that food from 1 to 10

735
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:39,200
okay like one is like I don't care 10 is

736
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,440
like I want to eat this right now and

737
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,039
the participants were hooked up to a

738
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,799
machine that was measuring their glucose

739
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:47,000
levels in real time and this is what the

740
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,799
scientists found they found that when

741
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,840
people's glucose levels were steady they

742
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:54,799
were rating all the foods like fiveish

743
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:58,200
Burger fiveish broccoli fiveish so you

744
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:59,720
know no particular Cravings but then

745
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,279
when the participants glucose levels

746
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:05,679
were dropping two things happened first

747
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:08,600
thing on the brain scan the craving

748
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,640
Center was activating and second thing

749
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,519
they started rating all of the sweet

750
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,720
Foods really highly okay and that just

751
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:18,919
goes to show that you cannot control

752
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,600
these Cravings they come from a deep

753
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:23,039
part of your brain that goes on to alert

754
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,720
mode when your glucose levels are

755
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,679
crashing because it is a dangerous thing

756
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,960
for the body right your body doesn't

757
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:31,480
know that that crash came from a spite

758
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,840
cuz you just ate 15

759
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:36,399
Donuts your body thinks it's low on

760
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,200
energy yeah um and so all this to say

761
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,000
that as you study your glucose levels

762
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:43,120
this craving Center will activate less

763
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,799
and less so naturally you're not going

764
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,000
to want to eat as much sugar and you're

765
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:49,919
going to switch from a situation in

766
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,159
which you were controlled by those

767
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:55,600
Cravings to a situation in which you'll

768
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:57,480
eat the sugar you really like for

769
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,840
pleasure for enjoyment without feeling

770
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,760
controlled M so instead of feeling like

771
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,480
oh my God I need to eat something sweet

772
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,919
right now give me anything any chocolate

773
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,159
bar it's more like hm you know what

774
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:11,640
tomorrow I want to go to my favorite

775
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:14,640
Bakery and get my favorite pastry you

776
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:17,720
know from a sense of like agency tot and

777
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,080
strength and boundaries versus being a

778
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,480
victim to that sugar addiction yeah you

779
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,720
can you can have that delayed

780
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,559
gratification exactly exactly no that's

781
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,320
huge I mean two things that really

782
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,159
helped me with this and I notice when

783
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,960
I'm weaker and this obviously happens

784
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:36,559
with the amount of travel I do and I

785
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:40,200
totally notice how that impacts my

786
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,559
desire for more sugar and I found that

787
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,360
one of the biggest commitments I had to

788
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:46,760
make was eating my meals on time every

789
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,159
day and that started to reduce craving

790
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,159
so when I was having breakfast at a

791
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,360
certain time lunch at a certain time and

792
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,000
dinner at a certain time I found myself

793
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,200
having less cravings and filling the

794
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,480
gaps with less sugar when I was missing

795
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,000
breakfast so I was missing lunch and

796
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,440
then I was trying to make up for it then

797
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,399
i' would be willing to take anything as

798
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,640
you're saying and the second thing I

799
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:07,799
found was when I had poor sleep when I

800
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,480
was sleeping badly or I wasn't sleeping

801
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:13,399
enough I would wake up craving sugar to

802
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,720
want to get me to the next meal and then

803
00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:16,159
naturally I'm going to have all these

804
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,080
things that aren't great for me because

805
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,640
I just haven't slept well and I found

806
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,640
that those two things had a massive

807
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,840
impact but how is what you're saying

808
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,240
having a an impact on the other way so

809
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,679
I'm saying how these lifestyle choices

810
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,600
impact my glucose Cravings but how are

811
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,120
our glucose levels impacting our well

812
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,279
for example sleep so sleep and glucose

813
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,600
are go hand in hand and so what you're

814
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:37,000
describing is if you wake up and you

815
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,320
haven't slept well you have more

816
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,880
cravings and you know what else happens

817
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,640
which is kind of unfortunate is that

818
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,559
when your body is tired it cannot

819
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,640
regulate your glucose levels as well so

820
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:49,679
anything you eat will create a bigger

821
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,559
glucose Spike right so for example if

822
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,679
you have that cake on a day when you're

823
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:56,000
rested versus a day when you're super

824
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,440
exhausted the exhausted day the cake

825
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,760
will make a bigger Spike you're eating

826
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,200
the same take but it's creating a bigger

827
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,320
Spike therefore a bigger crash therefore

828
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,960
more cravings and so when we're tired we

829
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,399
tend to crave more sweet foods and that

830
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,000
that makes a bigger Spike and a bigger

831
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:14,320
drop and then in turn being on a glucose

832
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
roller coaster also makes your sleep

833
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,240
that night worse not as deep not as

834
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,279
restorative so you start this vicious

835
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,399
cycle okay here's what to do to break

836
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:25,919
the cycle first of all use the hacks

837
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,440
when you wake up right so if you're

838
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,480
tired have a Savory breakfast

839
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,960
second thing to sort of reset your

840
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,600
glucose balance is to exercise even just

841
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,639
5 minutes so next time you wake up and

842
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,679
you're tired do five minutes of jumping

843
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:42,080
jacks put on a YouTube video five

844
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,960
minutes you know exercise anything

845
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,679
that's going to get your muscles working

846
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,880
is going to help you manage your glucose

847
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,159
levels better that day and then as you

848
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,840
study your glucose levels you will

849
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,200
notice you will sleep better and often

850
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,240
people will tell me that they used to

851
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:59,000
wake up in the middle of the night with

852
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,760
a pounding heart you know sweats that

853
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,360
can be because your glucose levels are

854
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,720
crashing as you're sleeping wow yeah and

855
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,639
that's why in my study so many people

856
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,679
improve their sleep not by taking

857
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:11,760
sleeping pills not by changing what's

858
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,600
happening in their bedroom just by

859
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,880
changing how they're eating everything

860
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,840
is connected Jay you cannot just look at

861
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:21,240
one thing in isolation when you improve

862
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,840
your glucose levels so many systems in

863
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,960
your body improve it's remarkable so you

864
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,039
might be entering this because you want

865
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,480
less inflammation or few cravings but

866
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:33,559
then what happens is you realize oh my

867
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,279
skin is better oh I sleep better oh my

868
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:36,519
mood has improved you know all these

869
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,120
amazing side effects it's really

870
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:40,200
beautiful to watch Yeah you mentioned

871
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,120
mood there what's the connection between

872
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,519
blood sugar levels and mental health

873
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,039
because I think again even though we are

874
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:49,039
making those connections now I think

875
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,080
often we don't recognize how correlated

876
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,639
our diet and our mental health is that's

877
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,120
the reason I got into this in the first

878
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:57,360
place so when I was a teenager I had an

879
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,639
accident I broke my back jumping off a

880
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,000
waterfall had very intense surgery I

881
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:03,399
have lotss of metal in my back now and

882
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,519
physically I was fine because you

883
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:07,279
recover fast when you're that young but

884
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,080
then my mental health started going

885
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,600
really down the drain so anxiety

886
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,440
depression

887
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,279
depersonalization my I felt like my

888
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,360
brain was completely broken I didn't

889
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:22,320
feel like myself anymore and I went on a

890
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,200
journey to try to understand how to get

891
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,039
better and that's what got me studying

892
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,120
biochemistry that's what got me into

893
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:33,440
genetics and then almost 10 years after

894
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:36,919
my accident 10 years of Darkness I

895
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,919
finally had my first clue I was part of

896
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:43,320
a pilot experiment and during it I could

897
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:45,360
wear a glucose monitor and I saw Jay

898
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:47,960
that the days where my glucose levels

899
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,399
were spiking and dropping a lot my

900
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,360
mental health was worse and the days

901
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:55,240
where my glucose levels were steady my

902
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:57,279
mental health was so much better and

903
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:00,200
this changed everything for me because I

904
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:02,880
had been completely lost for the better

905
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,320
part of a decade trying to understand

906
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,840
what the heck I could do to improve my

907
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:09,040
mental health and I was lost let me tell

908
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,760
you and nobody said oh you should look

909
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,919
at your lifestyle but in that moment I

910
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,200
remember that day I was feeling one of

911
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:18,480
these episodes come on of

912
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,960
depersonalization which is this horrible

913
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,480
mix of brain fog feeling like a stranger

914
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,639
in your own body I mean it's terrible

915
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,960
and I scan my glucose monitor and I see

916
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:30,159
one of the biggest glucose spikes I had

917
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,960
ever seen and so I started putting two

918
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,760
and two together I said wait a minute is

919
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:37,839
it possible that this glucose spike is

920
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:40,240
actually causing this episode anyway so

921
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:42,720
that opened the gates really wide for me

922
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,440
I was like wow this is fascinating and I

923
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,000
started doing all the research I could

924
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,159
and I I saw that I wasn't alone that

925
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,879
most people experience glucose spikes on

926
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:53,720
a daily basis even if they don't have

927
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:55,599
diabetes and that these spikes are

928
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:58,880
correlated to all the things we spoke

929
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:00,680
about and to Mental Health M so as I

930
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,560
started managing my glucose levels my

931
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:06,320
mental health started improving and so

932
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:10,280
what's the connection well the cells in

933
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,440
your brain also use glucose for energy

934
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,000
and so you know those three things I

935
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,240
talked about the mitochondrial damage

936
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,200
the glycation the inflammation the

937
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:22,640
insulin your brain cells also feel these

938
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:25,280
consequences of spikes and we don't

939
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,960
fully understand how the brain works but

940
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,280
we do understand that when these things

941
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,720
happen in the brain it's not

942
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,160
good we also know that glucose spikes

943
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:36,280
impact tyrosine levels and tyrosine is

944
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,160
an important molecule that regulates our

945
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,839
mood I want to talk you about another

946
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,520
really fun study can I okay yeah please

947
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:44,440
fascinating so bless these scientists

948
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:47,480
they're so amazing okay so let me tell

949
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:51,839
you what this study is so scientists

950
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:54,680
recruited 200 married couples MH they

951
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:58,000
gave each person in the couple a voodoo

952
00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:01,240
doll representing their spouse wow I

953
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,839
know they told the married people to

954
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:06,960
please over the next six weeks put a pin

955
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:08,359
in the voodoo doll every time your

956
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,079
spouse annoys

957
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:12,640
you and then at the end of the six weeks

958
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:15,079
the scientist got all the voodo dolls

959
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,720
back with all the pins in them and they

960
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:19,839
measured the participants glucose levels

961
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:23,079
they found that the people who had the

962
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:25,119
most irregular glucose levels had put

963
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:26,920
the most pins in the voodoo doll

964
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,280
representing their spouse and that's

965
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,160
where the tyus

966
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,079
hypothesis started com coming up they

967
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:35,960
saw that being on a glucose Roc cooster

968
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:38,160
can impact how irritable you are how you

969
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:41,920
see those around you how nice you are

970
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,520
how triggered you are by your spouse so

971
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,480
if you ever feel irritated agitated like

972
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,839
oh it's so annoying this person hate

973
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,640
them well maybe your glucose levels have

974
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:52,920
something to do with it so whether

975
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,960
you're trying to improve irritability

976
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,000
hungriness mental health anxiety

977
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,760
depression whatever managing your

978
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,200
glucose level again is a key foundation

979
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,760
in the house of your health yeah and for

980
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,480
me like it wasn't everything right after

981
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,880
I managed my glucose levels I had to go

982
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,880
to therapy do EMDR do lots of other

983
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:15,520
stuff but it gave me a foundation that

984
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:17,079
was so necessary as that first step yeah

985
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,760
well I think what you're laying up there

986
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:20,440
for us and that's definitely what I've

987
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,480
discovered in my own journey of mental

988
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,800
health and well-being is just that

989
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,319
you're just making it harder for

990
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,760
yourself when you're not using

991
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:29,319
everything at your disposal and I was

992
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,040
definitely someone who had used

993
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:34,560
mindfulness and meditation in order to

994
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,359
master the mind but I didn't realize how

995
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,560
hard that was when your body was slowing

996
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:40,960
you down and actually if your body was

997
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,680
with you the kind of Revelations and

998
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,720
breakthroughs you could have were

999
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,200
Limitless but when your body wasn't with

1000
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,839
you or for some people when their mind's

1001
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,839
not with their body it slows you down

1002
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:52,119
and it makes everything so much harder

1003
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:53,480
and I couldn't recommend that more to

1004
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:55,640
people like if you're someone who loves

1005
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,839
meditating and you love mindfulness but

1006
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,319
you're not taking care of your body and

1007
00:37:56,839 --> 00:38:00,359
you're not looking your glucose levels

1008
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:01,480
or your sleep take a look at it it's

1009
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:03,280
only going to make you a better

1010
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,640
meditator and if you're the other way

1011
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,720
around where you're like Jay this you

1012
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,800
know the physical stuff for me is easy I

1013
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,599
feel really fit and healthy it's really

1014
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,319
important to add the other side as well

1015
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:14,119
because you have no idea how good you

1016
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:16,400
can feel it's all connected and to give

1017
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:18,359
you another example um I've been

1018
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,760
recently really into weightlifting so it

1019
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:22,800
feels really good my body feels strong

1020
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,240
and I've noticed also my mental

1021
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,680
resilience has improved as my physical

1022
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:29,839
resilience has improved so I'm able to

1023
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,240
manage stress better I feel stronger and

1024
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,720
that's because you train your nervous

1025
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:35,800
system your body and your brain are

1026
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,920
connected by your nervous system right

1027
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,680
and so when you improve your physical

1028
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,440
health your nervous system improves and

1029
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,560
your mental health improves as well it's

1030
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,560
all it's all connected absolutely is

1031
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:49,480
there a more ideal food before or after

1032
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,520
workouts oh great question so this

1033
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,440
actually brings me to another hack which

1034
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:57,000
is the hack about movement so as your

1035
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,319
muscles contract and as you exercise or

1036
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,440
even as your you're just you know

1037
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:03,119
walking your muscles are burning glucose

1038
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,880
for energy and we can use this

1039
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,599
information to our advantage so the hack

1040
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,160
I recommend is after eating one of your

1041
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,800
meals a day after one of your meals a

1042
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:15,280
day use your muscles for 10 minutes go

1043
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:17,160
for a walk play with your dog tidy your

1044
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,680
apartment I'm a very messy person so I

1045
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,400
do that one a lot tidy your apartment do

1046
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,960
some calf raises if you're at your desk

1047
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,520
at work why not go to the gym you know

1048
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,520
go weightlift because as you do this

1049
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,280
your muscles are going to be using some

1050
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,720
of the glucose from the meal you just

1051
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:35,000
ate M and if you're an athlete and

1052
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,839
you're doing some very intense exercise

1053
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,440
your body is going to use up most of the

1054
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:42,119
glucose from whatever you eat so the

1055
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,440
more you exercise the more you can eat

1056
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:48,400
glucose before or even after actually um

1057
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,359
and you experience much less of a spike

1058
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,280
so if you want to eat a cookie or

1059
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:54,240
chocolate cake before after workout is

1060
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,839
actually a pretty good time to do it

1061
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,839
that way a lot of the glucose will go to

1062
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:59,160
your muscles instead of causing a that's

1063
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,760
what I've been trying to do so the

1064
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,480
reason I'm asking is for myself one of

1065
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,319
the things I struggle with is usually

1066
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,839
I'll wake up I'll meditate in the

1067
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:09,160
morning and then I'll drink a tea or

1068
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:11,640
something like that like a a warm herbal

1069
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,520
tea and then I'll go on a hike or I'll

1070
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,079
go and work out because I've never

1071
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,319
really found what to eat before my

1072
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,720
workout that's great for me and then

1073
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:20,560
when I come back I'll eat breakfast I'll

1074
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:22,440
have my Savory breakfast and I feel good

1075
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,280
and everything feels fine but I often

1076
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:27,760
wonder could I be doing something better

1077
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,079
before I go out on my hike which which

1078
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,280
can be like it'll be 30 minutes normal

1079
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,160
and then 30 minutes intense incline if

1080
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,800
you do eat something before going

1081
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,800
working out maybe a banana or something

1082
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,119
do you feel like you're able to work out

1083
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,200
better do you feel like you have more

1084
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,920
energy more explosivity that's a great

1085
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,640
question I think I'd have to monitor

1086
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,240
that to give you an like a honest answer

1087
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,000
and I would say that in the past I've

1088
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,280
tested things like dates but then I was

1089
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,359
worried that that was going to SP that's

1090
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,839
very high in sugar exactly so I had that

1091
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:57,920
recommendation from someone I tested it

1092
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,079
out I was like when I learned about

1093
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,359
everything to do with glucose I was like

1094
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:02,200
wait a minute that's probably not a good

1095
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:04,000
idea how intensely are you exercising

1096
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,000
are you just walking no so that's what I

1097
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,880
mean it's it's it's probably 30 minutes

1098
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,240
like easy and then 30 minutes of like

1099
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,079
explosive incline but it's not it's not

1100
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,880
high intensity in that it's not all fast

1101
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:18,119
it's self-paced but it is all uphill for

1102
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,880
30 minutes for example if I don't eat

1103
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:21,640
before I work out I don't perform as

1104
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,240
well right because as you're eating

1105
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,400
something that contains glucose that's

1106
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:27,560
going to feed your muscles very easy

1107
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,160
easily accessible energy so you could do

1108
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,240
some tests I I don't think dates are

1109
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,839
necessary because they're very high and

1110
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,440
sugar but you could even try something

1111
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:37,319
like you know a piece of sourdough bread

1112
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,960
right with an avocado on it or a a

1113
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:41,280
banana with some Nut Butter you don't

1114
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,800
have to have something so sweet and

1115
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,520
concentrated as a date but do some tests

1116
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,920
see what works for you now I know some

1117
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,680
options yeah you could even I like the

1118
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,960
avocado and S that's sounds you could do

1119
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,680
some almonds um you could do yogurt with

1120
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,240
some

1121
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,520
berries try some stuff out and see

1122
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,880
because you might find that you're

1123
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,480
actually walking faster yeah yeah yeah

1124
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,200
that would be good for me yeah

1125
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,640
definitely sometimes about going up that

1126
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,880
hill going why am I doing this today and

1127
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,119
and and I completely agree with and

1128
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,040
would you say it's the same for weight

1129
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:10,079
training before weight training is that

1130
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,280
the same typ of f big time Big Time

1131
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,079
especially if you're doing something

1132
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,720
like weight training which is you know

1133
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,480
more explosive than walking or running

1134
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,240
you have to really your muscle need to

1135
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,280
be able to go P you know so yes

1136
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:26,400
absolutely so my nutritionist put me on

1137
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,119
to this a couple of years ago and I

1138
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,040
hated it but then when I saw you like it

1139
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,000
was one of your big pillars oh I know

1140
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,280
what you're about to say you know what

1141
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,520
I'm about to say yeah go on vinegar yes

1142
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,160
yeah so I was drinking a cup of vinegar

1143
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:41,359
like the little whatever the shot of

1144
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,280
vinegar why a shot of vinegar before

1145
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:45,319
tell us first of all a shot is not good

1146
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,640
you should always dilute it because if

1147
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:49,280
it's a shot it's going to hurt your

1148
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,520
teeth I was literally doing a shot so

1149
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,680
I've got to change that you got to

1150
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:55,440
change that it's a lot easier to dilute

1151
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:58,680
yeah okay so vinegar contains a

1152
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,720
wonderful molecule called acetic acid

1153
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:04,119
and acetic acid when you have some

1154
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,760
before a meal is going to slow down how

1155
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:08,880
quickly food breaks down into glucose in

1156
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:11,599
your body so it's kind of like slowing

1157
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,280
down digestion and this is really really

1158
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:15,839
good it makes you feel Fuller full

1159
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,319
longer and the glucose molecules arrive

1160
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:20,440
more slowly into your blood and that's

1161
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:22,839
the whole point so the heck is before a

1162
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:26,160
meal that's going to be high in carbs

1163
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:28,720
have one tablespoon of vinegar in a big

1164
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,800
glass of water I was not doing that 5 to

1165
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,440
10 minutes yeah well no wonder you

1166
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,760
didn't like it if you had to do a shot

1167
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,760
like gosh and it can be any type of

1168
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,640
vinegar apple cider vinegar white wine

1169
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:41,280
vinegar Cherry vinegar whatever you just

1170
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:44,440
want to avoid the very syrupy like

1171
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,160
balsamic glaze that one's no bueno

1172
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,559
because that's full of sugar this is an

1173
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:51,280
easy hack and again science has shown us

1174
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:53,599
that this ingredient that most of us

1175
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,200
have in our kitchen actually has a

1176
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:58,119
wonderful effect on our health and it's

1177
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,400
been used for m Millenia I mean vinegar

1178
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:01,960
has been around forever but now we

1179
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,280
understand the science behind it it's a

1180
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:06,319
great hack and what all what before

1181
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,119
every meal or just lunch or is there a

1182
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,480
depends on how you feel I recommend

1183
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:12,720
before the meal of your day that's

1184
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:14,480
highest in sugar or starch right um and

1185
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,480
one of thing you can do is you know how

1186
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,280
I was explaining veggies first is so

1187
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,920
important you don't have to drink the

1188
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,960
vinegar you can also make it into

1189
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,800
dressing oh I like the and put it on

1190
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,760
your veggies okay that's you're making

1191
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,559
it easy now so you know the salad with

1192
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,040
some vinegret dressing

1193
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:30,559
wonderful way to start your meals

1194
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,760
wonderful you get the fiber from the

1195
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:35,960
veggies making that mesh and you get the

1196
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:38,280
vinegar slowing down breakdown of food

1197
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:40,480
you're golden got it okay now I can get

1198
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,280
back on it cuz I've been avoiding it it

1199
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,720
was so hard I was like I have to ask you

1200
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,079
about it today I'm not surprised I was

1201
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,640
doing a shot of vinegar and and you're

1202
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:49,920
right about the teeth as well I'm so

1203
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:52,680
sorry that's terrible that's kind of

1204
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,119
gross iame it was really hard to have

1205
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,400
and yeah every time I'd have it it would

1206
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:57,960
almost feel like it could start some

1207
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:00,160
reflux or it could have like uh you know

1208
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,640
that's not great oh I'm sorry no no it's

1209
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,319
good but as you can see this is another

1210
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:06,280
really easy hack it it's free it doesn't

1211
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,599
ask you to add any to remove anything

1212
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,319
you're just adding stuff and helping

1213
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,599
your body at the same time and then I

1214
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:14,440
like to see these hacks as sort of an

1215
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:16,280
on-ramp to freeway you know you kind of

1216
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,680
you kind of get on them and then after a

1217
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,720
few days you feel so much better and

1218
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,200
everything becomes easier in your life

1219
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,359
yeah no that's great what about for our

1220
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:26,000
snackers our snackers that are listening

1221
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:27,880
who are saying Jesse I love this advice

1222
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,240
I can do that for my but I'm a big

1223
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:32,839
snacker and I turn towards I mean today

1224
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:35,200
if you look at it whether it's a protein

1225
00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:37,760
bar but I guess protein bars is such a

1226
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,880
common go-to snack but they have really

1227
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,119
high sugar it depends on the bar yeah it

1228
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,520
really depends so look at the

1229
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,000
ingredients always and if you so when

1230
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,319
you look at the ingredients list on the

1231
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,920
back of a product they are ordered by

1232
00:45:47,319 --> 00:45:52,359
weight so if the first ingredient says

1233
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,440
sugar that means sugar is the most

1234
00:45:52,359 --> 00:45:57,119
important ingredient in that product and

1235
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,800
then they decrease right in in in weight

1236
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,480
so if you see in the first five

1237
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:04,440
ingredients of anything whether it's a

1238
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:06,319
protein bar or yogurt if there's any

1239
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,720
type of sugar in the first five

1240
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:10,960
ingredients then that product is

1241
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:13,880
dessert okay so if it says like that's

1242
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,960
such a great tip and it doesn't have to

1243
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:20,960
say just sugar it can say something like

1244
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:23,160
date puree honey dextrose fruit juice

1245
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,319
concentrate it has in glucose Revolution

1246
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:28,440
I have the whole list but manufacturers

1247
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:30,599
use lots of fancy words words to not

1248
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,960
make it sound like just cane sugar but

1249
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:34,359
actually it's just cane sugar it's all

1250
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,960
the same molecules right so sometimes

1251
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:38,079
you could your body's not telling the

1252
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,319
difference as you said no difference so

1253
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,040
that's for the protein bars and then for

1254
00:46:39,319 --> 00:46:44,839
the snackers okay I have a hack that's

1255
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:48,079
called putting clothing on your

1256
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:51,000
carbs anytime you eat carbs so carbs

1257
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:54,079
being starches or sugars make sure to

1258
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,000
never eat them naked and by naked I mean

1259
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:59,680
on their own mhm so never snack on just

1260
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,680
a piece of bread or never snack on just

1261
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,880
a cookie always add some clothing which

1262
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:07,040
means protein fat or Fiber which means

1263
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,680
for example adding some avocado to the

1264
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,839
bread or some cheese which means for

1265
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,280
example adding five almonds to the

1266
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:17,280
cookie or a Greek yogurt right so if you

1267
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:19,559
love snacking remember this hack put

1268
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,319
clothing on your carbs never eat your

1269
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:23,559
carbs naked that way you'll have less of

1270
00:47:21,319 --> 00:47:26,040
a glucose bike because the risk Jay is

1271
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:28,400
that our snacks kick off that Cravings

1272
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,400
roller coaster because between meals our

1273
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,160
stomach is empty so same concept as for

1274
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,480
breakfast you don't want to eat too much

1275
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,200
sweet stuff otherwise it's going to make

1276
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,240
a big spike and you're not going to feel

1277
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,200
very good 90 minutes later this is

1278
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,520
actually Genius Like if you're listening

1279
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,160
to this right now none of us have any

1280
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,839
excuses to shift this around genuinely

1281
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,440
I'm listening to you just going thank

1282
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:51,599
you like thank you so much because I

1283
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:53,040
think it's so often when you're hearing

1284
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:55,599
about how to change your diet and your

1285
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,720
food it just sounds so hard and so

1286
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,440
complex and it feels like like God where

1287
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:02,480
do I even start with this and and here

1288
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:04,720
we are just making really basic

1289
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,520
connections that that we can all do very

1290
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,040
very simply and it helps you with your

1291
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,680
energy with your mood with your skin but

1292
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:13,559
also for serious health conditions like

1293
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:16,280
type 2 diabetes this is the way out

1294
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:18,920
right if you have type two diabetes if

1295
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:21,000
one of your parents Grandparents has it

1296
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:22,680
it can be quite challenging to know how

1297
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,520
to get out of it and it can feel like

1298
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:26,559
either I have to go on this extreme diet

1299
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:28,640
and never eat carbs ever again or I'll

1300
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,680
do this medication and what I want to

1301
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,280
offer with these hacks is an easy way to

1302
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,000
take back some control over your glucose

1303
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,920
levels because type two diabetes is

1304
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,400
reversible it is not a genetic

1305
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,520
hereditary disease that you can't do

1306
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,920
anything about you can improve it I see

1307
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:44,599
people put it into remission every

1308
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,839
single week using this work in concert

1309
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:48,440
with their doctor of course but this is

1310
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:50,480
the kind of stuff that can turn your

1311
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:52,280
health around and instead of getting

1312
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,720
sicker as you age your health can

1313
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:56,319
improve as you age and don't we all want

1314
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,319
that that's the dream you know

1315
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,480
absolutely

1316
00:48:57,319 --> 00:49:01,040
yeah absolutely in the book you about

1317
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:03,720
there's some research that says that

1318
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:06,520
eating fruit first in the without any

1319
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:08,000
other Foods is best for digestion would

1320
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,760
eating it as a singular food first thing

1321
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,040
in the morning impact blood sugar like

1322
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,319
what's your take on that well you know

1323
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,760
this this idea of oh if you eat fruit as

1324
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:18,119
dessert it's going to rotten your

1325
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:20,599
stomach or it's going to purify that's

1326
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:22,839
kind of a urban myth that's been

1327
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:25,960
floating around so if you look at the

1328
00:49:22,839 --> 00:49:28,400
ideal food order from that science you

1329
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:30,760
should eat the sugar last right and

1330
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,359
fruit is also in the sugar category and

1331
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,799
so how do you reconcile both of those

1332
00:49:32,359 --> 00:49:35,359
things and people have asked me a lot

1333
00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:37,240
about this concept of oh fruit for

1334
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:39,599
dessert is going to rot in your stomach

1335
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,680
turns out there's no scientific evidence

1336
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:43,480
to support that nothing can rot in your

1337
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,760
stomach nothing can purify in your

1338
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:49,200
stomach sug sugar eaten last or fruit

1339
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,680
eaten last does not do that okay now

1340
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,920
even though most of us think that a

1341
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:54,960
piece of fruit is super natural they're

1342
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:58,240
like oh a banana or Peach like that's

1343
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:00,040
Nature's Bounty turns out Jay the fruit

1344
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,319
that we find today in supermarkets is

1345
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:05,400
actually not

1346
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:10,000
natural humans are very good at breeding

1347
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:11,880
stuff so humans have bred gry wolves

1348
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,920
into

1349
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:17,799
Chihuahuas right and loads of other

1350
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:21,480
breeds of dogs we've also bred our fruit

1351
00:50:17,799 --> 00:50:24,559
and our plants to be very sweet and full

1352
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:27,280
of sugar if you compare a banana from

1353
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:29,559
today to an ancestral banana

1354
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,040
they look nothing alike the ancestral

1355
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:34,760
banana is small full of seeds full of

1356
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:37,440
fiber quite tart modern day banana is

1357
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:39,480
basically dessert same for apples apples

1358
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:42,040
used to be small like cherries now

1359
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:44,880
they're this big nice little plump

1360
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:46,760
package of water and sugar

1361
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,240
essentially if you want to eat something

1362
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,599
sweet the piece of whole fruit is still

1363
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,200
the best thing to eat because of that

1364
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,880
protective fiber and I explained the

1365
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,640
fiber makes that mesh in your intestine

1366
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:58,400
but then as soon as you denature a piece

1367
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:00,480
of fruit whether you juice it you take

1368
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,720
away the fiber you blend it you

1369
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:05,119
pulverize the fiber then it becomes just

1370
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,440
one big glucose bike waiting to happen

1371
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:08,839
and it's not because something comes

1372
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:10,240
from fruit that it's good for you yeah

1373
00:51:08,839 --> 00:51:13,319
that's a really good explanation I

1374
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:15,440
appreciate that I think there's always

1375
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:16,920
been people who've demonized fruit as

1376
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,240
well in that way but I think that

1377
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:20,280
explanation actually gets into the

1378
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,079
nuance and subtlety of how we're having

1379
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:24,760
our fruit and I never going to say Don't

1380
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,359
eat fruit it's totally fine to eat fruit

1381
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,119
seriously it's much better to eat fruit

1382
00:51:26,359 --> 00:51:30,680
than a cookie right for your glucose

1383
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:33,160
levels for your body and it is still an

1384
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:35,359
unprocessed food right it's been bred

1385
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:38,119
and Chang that's the but it's still

1386
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:40,000
unprocessed so of course have fruit just

1387
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:41,319
don't denature that fruit totally

1388
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,160
because then you're taking it even

1389
00:51:41,319 --> 00:51:45,119
further and further away from the way

1390
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,640
nature intended us to consume it yeah I

1391
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,520
actually remember when I first went to

1392
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:52,200
India with my mom and my mom was making

1393
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,799
me the same cures that she would make me

1394
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,760
in London but now making them when we

1395
00:51:53,799 --> 00:51:58,640
were living in India just for a bit we

1396
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,839
went visiting when I was younger and

1397
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:03,480
it's so interesting because each

1398
00:52:00,839 --> 00:52:05,559
vegetable was so flavorful but so

1399
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:07,599
different and I'm sure you feel this

1400
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:09,319
back home or when you're traveling like

1401
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:11,240
you can find these places in the world

1402
00:52:09,319 --> 00:52:13,280
where you're eating real vegetables

1403
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:16,160
again or real fruits and they don't look

1404
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,400
as perfect they all look imperfect

1405
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,720
random yeah they've got personalities

1406
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,359
and even the flavors are not consistent

1407
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,680
so like a zuun is going to taste

1408
00:52:22,359 --> 00:52:26,359
different to another one but it's still

1409
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,720
so flavorful but in such a unique way

1410
00:52:26,359 --> 00:52:29,240
and and I remember saying to my mom like

1411
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,480
what are you doing here like what are

1412
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,559
you doing differently in India that

1413
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,920
you're not doing back in London it was

1414
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:36,880
just what was accessible and and I think

1415
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,760
that's in the states for sure where I

1416
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,040
feel that even more than from London

1417
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,599
where in London I still felt certain

1418
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,280
vegetables and everything were still

1419
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:46,920
accessible but here I I really feel like

1420
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,440
a lot of the vegetables and fruits that

1421
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,480
we're eating are super processed y yeah

1422
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,000
yeah absolutely it's really tough uh one

1423
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:56,599
of your other hacks uh is stop counting

1424
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,839
calories and I wanted to talk about that

1425
00:52:56,599 --> 00:53:00,520
because I think that's what all of us do

1426
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:04,400
and again that again the recommended

1427
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:06,720
2,000 for women and 2500 for men seems

1428
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:09,200
to be like such a big figure that we

1429
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:12,280
focus our whole diet plans on and lives

1430
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:15,079
on I love this question do you know Jay

1431
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:18,280
how people used to measure the amount of

1432
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:20,280
calories in a food I don't know okay so

1433
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:23,799
if they wanted to measure the amount of

1434
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:26,079
calories in a donut here's what they

1435
00:53:23,799 --> 00:53:28,440
used to do they would put the donut in a

1436
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:31,640
little box box and they would put this

1437
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:34,079
box in a bigger like an aquarium like a

1438
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:35,920
big Basin of water okay they put the

1439
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,720
doughnut box at the bottom of the

1440
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:42,000
aquarium and then they would light the

1441
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:44,119
doughnut Inside the Box on fire the

1442
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,599
doughnut would burn and then they would

1443
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:51,319
measure by how many degrees the water in

1444
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:52,240
the aquarium increased oh my gosh so and

1445
00:53:51,319 --> 00:53:54,440
that would give you the number of

1446
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:57,359
calories in the donuts the calories is

1447
00:53:54,440 --> 00:54:01,119
just a measure of how much heat

1448
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:02,760
is given up when something is burned so

1449
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:05,119
if you were to put an avocado in that

1450
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:06,799
box and burn it it might increase the

1451
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:08,520
water temperature around it by the exact

1452
00:54:06,799 --> 00:54:10,400
same number of degrees therefore you

1453
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,839
would say this doughnut and this avocado

1454
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:15,440
have the same number of

1455
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:17,280
calories now it seems pretty obvious

1456
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:20,760
that this is kind of a silly way to

1457
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:23,160
measure food it's almost like saying oh

1458
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:25,240
this book and this book have the same

1459
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,760
number of pages Pages therefore they're

1460
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:29,559
the same book yeah this is not the case

1461
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,920
right my book and your book might have

1462
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:32,240
the same number of pages but they're not

1463
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,960
about the same topic they're not from

1464
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,359
the same author they don't give you the

1465
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,640
same information don't give you the same

1466
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:40,799
emotion right and so if we just talk

1467
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,119
about Foods based on how many calories

1468
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:45,839
they contain we're missing what's

1469
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:48,240
actually key what is in that food what

1470
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:50,520
are the molecules in that food is that

1471
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:52,680
food just glucose and going to create a

1472
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:54,160
big glucose bike or is that food just

1473
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,200
healthy fats and protein and going to

1474
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:59,079
keep your glucose level steady to give

1475
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:01,760
you another example two people could be

1476
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:04,640
eating the exact same number of calories

1477
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:08,079
let's say two women are eating 2,000

1478
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:09,760
calories a day one of them could be

1479
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:12,079
eating in a way that keeps her glucose

1480
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,880
level steady feel great energy

1481
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:15,400
functioning mitochondria clear brain

1482
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:17,040
going after her dreams girl boss

1483
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:19,400
whatever the other person could be

1484
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,359
eating 2,000 calories in a way that's

1485
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:23,319
creating lots of glucose spikes

1486
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:26,760
inflammation aging type two diabetes

1487
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:28,640
hormonal issues brain fog etc etc etc

1488
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:31,039
how many calories you're eating does not

1489
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,599
tell you how healthy you are does not

1490
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:35,319
predict your health at all you need to

1491
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:37,440
learn about what you're eating and in my

1492
00:55:35,319 --> 00:55:39,799
book I explain how to identify the

1493
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,280
molecules in a food and if you follow my

1494
00:55:39,799 --> 00:55:43,839
hacks and you stop counting calories

1495
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,920
naturally your health is going to

1496
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:48,079
improve you might be eating the exact

1497
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:50,760
same number of calories as before but

1498
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:53,000
your life will be completely different

1499
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,760
calories are not enough information

1500
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,119
they're interesting to measure the

1501
00:55:54,760 --> 00:56:00,359
quantity of a food for example one dut

1502
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:03,480
versus two Donuts but they're not

1503
00:56:00,359 --> 00:56:05,200
sufficient and it's really easy to hide

1504
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,480
behind calories when you're for example

1505
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:09,359
a food manufacturer and you're making

1506
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:12,640
processed foods and you say there's only

1507
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:14,039
50 calories in this little bag of sweets

1508
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,480
don't worry it's not bad for you it's

1509
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:18,240
just 50 calories yeah but it's 50

1510
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,880
calories of pure sugar and it's going to

1511
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:23,680
make you feel horrible so calories are

1512
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,720
not enough we need to evolve past this I

1513
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,520
want to teach people what is in their

1514
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:30,520
food I want to make every single one of

1515
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:33,079
my readers a food detective I want them

1516
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:35,680
to have all the agency the power the

1517
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:37,599
information to make informed choices

1518
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,599
when they go to the supermarket that's

1519
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:41,559
the goal right giving people that

1520
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:43,280
freedom and that power that's what I

1521
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:45,119
care about yeah that's such a brilliant

1522
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,760
Mission like that's such a brilliant

1523
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:49,280
Mission because even everything you've

1524
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,960
said to us today whether it's being able

1525
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,559
to know what to look at on the back of a

1526
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,240
pack all the way to putting clothing on

1527
00:56:53,559 --> 00:56:57,400
your cars I just I was just about to say

1528
00:56:55,240 --> 00:57:00,240
that like putting clothing on your like

1529
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:02,799
I love that it comes for you in your

1530
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,839
heart and mind from a place of giving

1531
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:07,640
people agency and giving people strength

1532
00:57:04,839 --> 00:57:09,920
and rather than making us fearful which

1533
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:11,400
I think a lot of diet plans do a lot of

1534
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,680
food advice does it makes us quite

1535
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,520
insecure and scared that we're doing the

1536
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,640
wrong thing whereas when I'm talking to

1537
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:20,319
you I feel a sense of like enthusiasm

1538
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:22,839
and confidence I know what to do good

1539
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:24,680
and that's so that's so fulfilling like

1540
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:26,720
it's so it fills you with so much

1541
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:29,599
enthusiasm and energy

1542
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,799
to to feel like yes I am in control of

1543
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,920
how I'm going to feel and what I'm going

1544
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:34,920
to eat you are and the information is

1545
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:36,440
there and I'm I just want to apologize

1546
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:38,559
to all the people who've been

1547
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:41,240
manipulated by food marketing diet

1548
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:43,480
culture that stuff stop it can stop if

1549
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:45,160
you get this information this will stop

1550
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:46,760
and the thing that breaks my heart the

1551
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:49,160
most Jay and I think this is what

1552
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:50,960
motivates me to do this work is when I

1553
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:53,319
meet somebody who has a medical

1554
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:55,400
condition like type two diabetes and

1555
00:57:53,319 --> 00:57:57,200
everybody wants to make the right

1556
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:59,039
choices every everybody wants to be

1557
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,160
healthier but because of the

1558
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:03,000
manipulation and all the misleading

1559
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:06,000
information about food they're eating in

1560
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,440
a way that they think and they hope is

1561
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,440
good for them but is actually making

1562
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,319
them sicker and that's what I want to

1563
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,440
stop I want to insert this information

1564
00:58:11,319 --> 00:58:15,119
in this science in those situation and

1565
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,520
turn it all around for people yeah I

1566
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:18,599
love that I love that uh Jesse we talked

1567
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,520
about so many things today but one thing

1568
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:22,920
I wanted to ask you about was the use of

1569
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:25,280
supplements I take a lot of supplements

1570
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:27,200
every day I felt better because of them

1571
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:28,839
it's had a big imp impact on my personal

1572
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,240
life and I was always someone who was

1573
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,440
playing around I think supplements are

1574
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,599
also things that you have to test and

1575
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,599
experiment and see what works for you as

1576
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,559
a combination what's your take on

1577
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:39,280
supplements well I know supplements in

1578
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:40,599
the glucose space right and I can't

1579
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,559
comment on all the other stuff I'm sure

1580
00:58:40,599 --> 00:58:43,880
there's great things for other stuff

1581
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,839
you're trying to optimize but when it

1582
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:48,440
comes to glucose so people often ask me

1583
00:58:46,839 --> 00:58:51,319
instead of doing the vinegar hack can I

1584
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:54,000
take a vinegar gummy when I can't have a

1585
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:55,680
veggie starter can I take fiber pills my

1586
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,720
dad has diabetes doesn't want to change

1587
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:00,599
his diet what can I give him and I spent

1588
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:03,079
the last few years researching

1589
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:05,440
extensively this space and what are some

1590
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:07,760
cool molecules that could actually help

1591
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:10,520
your glucose levels unfortunately what's

1592
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:12,200
on the market today at worst actually

1593
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:14,359
contains sugar and creates a glucose

1594
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,920
bike under the guise of going to help

1595
00:59:14,359 --> 00:59:19,000
you with your glucose levels and that's

1596
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:20,480
just so annoying to me and there's some

1597
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,720
good stuff out there but I've actually

1598
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:25,480
created something incredible that is the

1599
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:27,880
best thing on the market if you want to

1600
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:30,799
help your journey to steady glucose with

1601
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:31,960
a supplement now I'll explain what it is

1602
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:33,640
but I don't want people to think this is

1603
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,680
a magic pill you should do the food

1604
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:37,599
hacks first and foremost okay that is

1605
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:39,680
going to have the biggest most powerful

1606
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:42,079
impact on your health but a supplement

1607
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:45,480
can also help so I've identified four

1608
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:47,760
plants Jay that have existed forever but

1609
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:50,240
that recent science has shown have an

1610
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:53,200
incredible impact on our glucose levels

1611
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:56,359
these are white mulbury leaf lemon

1612
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:58,559
extract cinnamon and antioxidants from

1613
00:59:56,359 --> 01:00:00,559
green vegetables I've put them all

1614
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:03,000
together into a capsule you take it

1615
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:07,319
before a meal and it reduces the glucose

1616
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:09,400
Spike of your meal by up to 40% wow and

1617
01:00:07,319 --> 01:00:13,119
this is more powerful than vinegar which

1618
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:15,559
was up to 30% I know me I got some for

1619
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:19,200
you good I'm being serious I've got some

1620
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:21,319
so if you want extra help this is the

1621
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:23,559
thing you need it's called anti-spike

1622
01:00:21,319 --> 01:00:26,920
formula you can find it on my website

1623
01:00:23,559 --> 01:00:28,880
antis spike.com and it not only has this

1624
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:31,559
immediate impact on the glucose Spike of

1625
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:34,400
a meal it also builds up benefit over

1626
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:37,119
time it reduces inflammation it reduces

1627
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:39,440
your fasting glucose levels it increases

1628
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:41,160
gp1 which is a hormone we've spoken a

1629
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,799
lot about recently in the media because

1630
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:45,760
of things like OIC gp1 is a really cool

1631
01:00:43,799 --> 01:00:48,200
hormone that just makes you feel Fuller

1632
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:50,079
and OIC tricks your brain into thinking

1633
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:52,160
there's more gp1 in your body than there

1634
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:54,760
actually is but with anti-spike you're

1635
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:57,599
actually harnessing natural Pathways to

1636
01:00:54,760 --> 01:01:00,520
increase it for real mhm so this is my

1637
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:02,079
latest creation and I hope it's going to

1638
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:03,920
help a lot of people you know when

1639
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:05,760
you're 4M birthday party when you're

1640
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,400
traveling when you can't do the hacks

1641
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:09,720
anti- Spike will be there for you but

1642
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,599
again do the food hacks first it's just

1643
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:13,640
an additional hack to help yeah yeah I

1644
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:15,319
want to try it for sure I have it in my

1645
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,760
yeah I love that what is your take on

1646
01:01:15,319 --> 01:01:18,520
asmic I mean based on what you just

1647
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,880
mentioned there what's been your

1648
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:22,079
assessment of it I'm sure you've seen

1649
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:23,559
people who are on it yeah listen I think

1650
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:26,559
for a lot of people it's been kind of a

1651
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:28,119
godsend um they've really struggled

1652
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:30,640
their whole life with their weight and

1653
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:33,000
for some people that's their objective

1654
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:35,760
right so whether you take it or you

1655
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:38,280
don't take it it's not my place to judge

1656
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:41,280
but what I found Jay is that if you

1657
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:43,440
think about it this craze has shown us

1658
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:46,400
that we live in a society in which our

1659
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:49,000
food system is so toxic that we need to

1660
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:51,079
take a pill to prevent us from eating

1661
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,920
the food around us do you understand how

1662
01:01:51,079 --> 01:01:56,640
sad that is so I just feel a bit worried

1663
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,640
and a bit disheartened we've gone to

1664
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:00,319
we've gone to that place and also when

1665
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:02,559
people lose weight on OIC they don't

1666
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:04,319
just lose fat they also lose muscle mass

1667
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:06,760
and so when you stop taking oing and if

1668
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:08,960
you um gain weight back you often just

1669
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:10,640
gain fat back and so overall you're in a

1670
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:13,640
worse place so whether or not you take

1671
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:17,039
it it's important to learn my hacks so

1672
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:21,480
that way when you stop it you sustain it

1673
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:24,440
right but um yeah I mean wow wow what

1674
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:26,200
can I say crazy world we live in yeah

1675
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:28,520
absolutely and I appreciate you touching

1676
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:30,319
on that cultural challenge that we have

1677
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:32,720
on a number of parts in our conversation

1678
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:35,319
and I really think that that's at the

1679
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:37,839
heart of a lot of what you're saying is

1680
01:02:35,319 --> 01:02:40,279
that everyone out there who's listening

1681
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:42,720
right now who feels

1682
01:02:40,279 --> 01:02:44,599
like they don't like the way they eat

1683
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:46,400
they don't like what they eat they judge

1684
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:48,079
their body they look at the mirror first

1685
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:50,680
thing in the morning and criticize

1686
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:52,319
themselves it all comes from programming

1687
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:54,000
and conditioning it's not your fault

1688
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:56,359
it's not your fault and it was you were

1689
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,240
set up to feel that way yes and there's

1690
01:02:56,359 --> 01:03:00,160
a lot of money being made off your back

1691
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,839
because you feel that way yeah and so I

1692
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:04,359
think a lot of people we beat ourselves

1693
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:05,799
up we think oh what's wrong with me or

1694
01:03:04,359 --> 01:03:07,559
there must be something really bad with

1695
01:03:05,799 --> 01:03:09,000
me or oh my gosh I'm not disciplined

1696
01:03:07,559 --> 01:03:10,559
enough and I don't have good it's not

1697
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,200
about discipline it's not about Laz

1698
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:14,920
everything Temptation choices yeah toxic

1699
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,760
food around you that's cheap mising

1700
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,599
marketing messages you know incorrect

1701
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:20,400
information so we need to go back to

1702
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:22,000
teaching people how their body actually

1703
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,880
functions in the science and the

1704
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,039
physiology and you know Jay I hope I

1705
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:28,000
will become completely irrelevant I hope

1706
01:03:26,039 --> 01:03:30,200
this information will be so common

1707
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,240
knowledge people will be like yep wear a

1708
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:34,160
sunscreen drink water brush your teeth

1709
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:36,200
have a savory breakfast like I want my

1710
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:39,440
stuff to be at that level and I want to

1711
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:40,760
retire and disappear because everybody

1712
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,960
needs to know this it should be taught

1713
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:44,039
in schools it's basic right to

1714
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,640
understand how your body functions and

1715
01:03:44,039 --> 01:03:47,760
how to navigate this difficult food

1716
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:49,400
landscape that we live in absolutely and

1717
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,119
and the courage that any of you have

1718
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:53,559
right now who are listening and even

1719
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:55,319
wanting to take one step towards that

1720
01:03:53,559 --> 01:03:57,440
agency that Jesse's been talking about

1721
01:03:55,319 --> 01:03:59,680
that's a huge win because we're

1722
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:02,680
operating in a society where even taking

1723
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:03,839
that one step is often so difficult

1724
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:05,599
because of all the messages we're

1725
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:07,039
hearing around us so anyone who's

1726
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:09,440

minute you're actually trying to share

1780

least I've heard I don't have kids but

1782
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,640
I've learned that a lot of people feel

1783
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,880
this with their children where your

1784
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:14,799
child's trying to communicate with you

1785
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,279
and just doesn't know how and it's

1786
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:17,799
almost like our body's like that yeah

1787
01:06:16,279 --> 01:06:20,039
it's like a baby doesn't cry because

1788
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:21,359
it's trying to annoy you a baby cries is

1789

01:06:33,319 --> 01:06:38,359
do with uh fruit juices fruit smoothies

1797
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:40,520
as being a health food anything no just

1798
01:06:38,359 --> 01:06:43,760
like no yeah don't do it do it don't do

1799
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:45,119
it okay uh question number three what's

1800
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,359
the first thing you do in the morning

1801
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,920
and the last thing you do before you go

1802
01:06:46,359 --> 01:06:49,839
to bed the first thing I do in the

1803
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:52,520
morning I take my earplugs out and I

1804
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:54,720
drink water so you do have water first

1805
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:56,119
in the morning that's it yeah absolutely

1806
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:58,039
and then I try to turn my phone on a

1807
01:06:56,119 --> 01:07:00,079
little bit later I try to not turn it on

1808
01:06:58,039 --> 01:07:01,599
in the first half an hour last thing I

1809
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:03,079
do at night before going to bed I have

1810
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:05,400
this app in which I track my mental

1811
01:07:03,079 --> 01:07:07,000
health so I put a little a scale of one

1812
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,640
to five how my mental health was today

1813
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,400
and I write a couple sentences about my

1814
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:12,440
day nice what is the app code it's

1815
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:15,559
called Dao okay have no affiliation

1816
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:17,119
whatsoever it's awesome d a y l i o and

1817
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:18,799
I've been doing this for four years now

1818
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:20,760
and it makes a little dot for I'll show

1819
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:23,960
you in a sec it makes a little dot for

1820
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:26,599
every day and so I have four years of

1821
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:28,000
dots of how mental health was in all of

1822
01:07:26,599 --> 01:07:29,720
those days and I see these patterns I

1823
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,480
see that I've gotten happier over time

1824
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:33,760
more fulfilled have less episodes of

1825
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:35,039
difficult mental health issues so it's

1826
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,960
really cool to look back that's

1827
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:39,039
beautiful I love that that's a great

1828
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:41,640
recommendation for everyone listening uh

1829
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:43,760
fourth question what's something that

1830
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:45,640
you used to believe to be true about

1831
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,480
health but now you've realized it's

1832
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:50,119
actually not true uh that everybody

1833
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:51,760
should wear a glucose monitor so when I

1834
01:07:50,119 --> 01:07:53,440
first started in the space because

1835
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:55,599
wearing the glucose monitor had changed

1836
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:59,079
my life I was telling everybody to wear

1837
01:07:55,599 --> 01:08:01,920
one and now I realize that you can get

1838
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:02,960
all the benefits by seeing what I've

1839
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,599
discovered and the science that I've

1840
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:07,279
found and sometimes overt tracking

1841
01:08:04,599 --> 01:08:08,839
yourself can lead to issues and stress

1842
01:08:07,279 --> 01:08:10,760
yeah I I can relate to that there was a

1843
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:14,039
point where I was measuring everything

1844
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:15,520
yeah and it was useful and then it went

1845
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:17,359
too far and then I didn't want to

1846
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,759
measure anything and then it's it's a

1847
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:21,359
it's a really interesting balance

1848
01:08:18,759 --> 01:08:23,600
because data can be so powerful and at

1849
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:25,640
the same it can be so disempowering

1850
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,839
because sometimes you look at the data

1851
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:29,480
decide how you feel about yourself yeah

1852
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:31,000
yeah it's like you know yeah you let

1853
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:32,199
exactly you wake up and you're like I

1854
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,239
don't know if I'm tired or not look at

1855
01:08:32,199 --> 01:08:35,520
my sleep data oh I'm exhausted clearly

1856
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:37,199
because I didn't sleep all but you're

1857
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,640
actually not connected to how you feel

1858
01:08:37,199 --> 01:08:40,480
yeah yeah and it takes you outside of

1859
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,120
your body exactly exactly it's what

1860
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:44,799
you're saying earlier we need to

1861
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:48,239
actually get better at living in our

1862
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:50,600
bodies and listening within our bodies

1863
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:52,319
and hearing and feeling what they're

1864
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:55,199
saying to us and how they're

1865
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:58,960
communicating rather than expecting that

1866
01:08:55,199 --> 01:09:01,000
even even an external person or system

1867
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:02,920
is going to somehow predict how we feel

1868
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,000
amen yeah that's a really really

1869
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:06,319
powerful take away I love that uh Fifth

1870
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,279
and final question which we asked to

1871
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:10,359
every guest who's ever been on the show

1872
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:12,520
if you could create one law that

1873
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:14,560
everyone in the world had to follow what

1874
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:16,440
would it be okay I'm going to restrict

1875
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,719
myself to the world of food okay because

1876
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:19,239
there's lots of other laws that we could

1877
01:09:17,719 --> 01:09:21,000
do that would be very important in the

1878
01:09:19,239 --> 01:09:23,560
world and it can be a real law like you

1879
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,560
know yeah yeah ban all processed

1880
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:27,880
breakfast food m I love that love

1881
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:31,279
because that would help kids it would

1882
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:34,319
help parents it would change

1883
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:37,120
people's mood make them happier more

1884
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:38,880
fulfilled yeah I think that's a big one

1885
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:40,920
that's huge or like the law could be

1886
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:42,600
treat breakfast like any other meal

1887
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:45,120
because if you ban something then other

1888
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:47,560
stuff pops up so it's more like treat

1889
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:49,839
breakfast as the second lunch and eat

1890
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:53,920
lunch food at breakfast yeah that's

1891
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:55,920

1920
01:10:48,679 --> 01:10:54,080
interview with Dr Daniel aan on how to

1921
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:57,880
change your life by changing your brain

1922
01:10:54,080 --> 01:11:00,360
if we want to Healthy Mind it actually

1923
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:03,440
starts with a healthy brain you know

1924
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:06,719
I've had the blessing or the curse to

1925
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:09,080
scan over a thousand convicted felons

1926
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:12,840
and over a hundred murderers and their

1927
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:12,840
brains are very damaged
