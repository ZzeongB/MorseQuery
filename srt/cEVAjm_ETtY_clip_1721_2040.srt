713
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
what would be the ideal breakfast for

714
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,480
anyone whether like and let's just talk

715
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,240
about the person who just wants to move

716
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,600
more they want to take better care of

717
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,319
their body they want to understand how

718
00:00:10,319 --> 00:00:12,839
their body works so that you're getting

719
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,199
better results and you're feeling better

720
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,800
in your life so what would breakfast

721
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,240
look like just on an average morning if

722
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,319
you know for anybody yeah that I will

723
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:25,959
say that it's a hard one because people

724
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,480
have different food preferences how

725
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,319
about an avatar what's an avatar a a

726
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:32,160
makeup person okay a makeup person

727
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,719
makeup person so we'll say there's a

728
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,959
woman who is plant-based but not

729
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:39,240
vegetarian know so she has a preference

730
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,280
for plants three kids you know super

731
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,400
busy wakes up has been waking up tired

732
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,199
but wired didn't sleep well was like

733
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:48,760
okay I need to make this change never

734
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,760
hungry in the morning so we can split

735
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,679
her breakfast it could be overnight oats

736
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:55,839
which is chiaia seeds oatmeal some um

737
00:00:55,839 --> 00:00:59,120
milk or or oat milk to soak it then when

738
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,439
she gets up she's like I'm going to

739
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:03,079
split that in half the first half I'm

740
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:05,319
going to add some berries and maybe

741
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,520
another tablespoon of Greek yogurt CU

742
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,240
then I'm going to get some protein

743
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,480
carbohydrate some Fiber and it's going

744
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,719
to calm me down it's going to tell my

745
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,000
brain yep ready to go okay then

746
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,880
you either are going out for your walk

747
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,959
maybe you're going to do some home

748
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:21,719
strength training maybe you're meeting a

749
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:24,640
friend for a session maybe you're taking

750
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,760
15 minutes of Just Breath work to to

751
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,920
bring yourself down especially if you're

752
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,719
the Avatar of three kids in a busy life

753
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,640
just taking that moment to put yourself

754
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,480
first and then when you get back maybe

755
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,280
it's an hour hour and a half later you

756
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,319
have the second half the second half of

757
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,520
those overnight oats with a few more

758
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,520
tablespoons of Greek yogurt and some

759
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,880
nuts and berries because then you're

760
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,679
getting the protein carbohydrate so

761
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:51,920
you've actually split your breakfast but

762
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,920
you've given your body the benefit of

763
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,520
food on different eating opportunities

764
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,880
without being over full but at the end

765
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,319
you end up with 30 grams of protein over

766
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,959
the course of a couple of hours so it's

767
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:07,040
easy you can mix it up do it the night

768
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,520
before you know that I'm not that hungry

769
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,800
but if I have a little bit and then over

770
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,520
the course of a couple of weeks you're

771
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,719
going to find that you're going to wake

772
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,400
up go yeah I need some food and this is

773
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,360
kind of a reset of your circadian rhythm

774
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,480
your body is starting to fall in line

775
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,000
your hypothalamus is understanding your

776
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,920
appetite hormones are starting to work

777
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,959
properly and when all of that feeds

778
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,920
forward then you're going to start to

779
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,040
see changes in body composition because

780
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,640
you're having better sleep because we

781
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,760
can't change anything if our sleep is

782
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,360
perturbed so the more we focus on how

783
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,199
are we going to work with our body's

784
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,439
natural rhythms and the way that our

785
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,400
hormones work the the more it feeds into

786
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,959
better parasympathetic drive for better

787
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,719
sleep I have just so screwed this up

788
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,880
like I literally wake up I delay the

789
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,079
coffee I exercise on an empty stomach I

790
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,199
then have my coffee which I'm then

791
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:01,240
drinking on an empty stomach which means

792
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,760
I've now maximized stressing myself out

793
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,000
and then I'm slamming something that has

794
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,079
30 45 grams of protein after I work out

795
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:13,520
and so what have you done if you are the

796
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,079
kind of person like I am that you've

797
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:17,760
bought into all the BS and you've

798
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,559
basically been starving yourself in the

799
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:22,199
morning and even if you get out for a

800
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,400
walk how are you kind of actually not

801
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,040
only not getting the benefit but you're

802
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,480
making it worse what's happening in like

803
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,839
the person's body when you do not feed

804
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:34,520
yourself first thing in the morning as a

805
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,240
woman yeah I always bring it down to

806
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,199
what are we doing when when we want to

807
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:42,679
exercise right we're looking for better

808
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:44,559
blood glucose control we're looking for

809
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:46,280
better bone we're looking for better

810
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,480
muscle if you're not eating then you are

811
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,199
not going to get better at any of that

812
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,600
stuff because the body again is like I

813
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,799
need fuel for the stress that's

814
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,319
occurring and I need fuel for the

815
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,559
exercise so if you've been brainwashed

816
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:02,959
like I am MH and you're exercising

817
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,920
because you are trying to like lose

818
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,040
weight or you're trying to look thin

819
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,520
MH what is happening if I continue to go

820
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,319
down that route where I don't eat before

821
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,360
I exercise and I'm basically starving

822
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,799
myself and I'm going for my walk and I'm

823
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,240
delaying food you lose muscle and then

824
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,000
the other thing when we look at women

825
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,240
who are late 30s early 40s onwards we

826
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,480
get a signal to put on more visceral fat

827
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,679
so that's that deep belly fat that that

828
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:33,319
metabolically active that can be

829
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:37,679
dangerous so I'll see women who are at

830
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:39,199
you know doing the same Pursuit and

831
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,280
really proud of the fact that they're

832
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,719
intermittent fasting they're not

833
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:43,640
breaking their fast till noon they've

834
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,040
had their coffee to hold them through

835
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,360
and you do a DEA and what's a DEA a DEA

836
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,679
is when you go and you get a complete

837
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:54,079
body scan so it looks at your muscle it

838
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,480
looks at fat where Fat's put it looks at

839
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,199
how dense your bones are so we see their

840
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,000
dexa results and on the outside they

841
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,240
look healthy right but on the inside

842
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,799
it's a bit of a scary story where we see

843
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:10,880
low bone density we see an increase of

844
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,719
fat accumulating in the belly area which

845
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:15,719
means that it's more what we call

846
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:17,880
metabolically active so you see a change

847
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,040
in your um cholesterol so you have more

848
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,679
of the quote bad cholesterol that's
